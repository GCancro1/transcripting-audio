Speaker 0    00:00:01    Okay. So we are here at Bollywood salon in Elmhurst, New York on Broadway avenue, and it is August 8th and it's 1:50 PM. And I am here with Shaza Hafe. So can you state your full name and the number of years you've been doing hair?  
Speaker 1    00:00:26    Um, Shaza ha my name and I went to beauty school in 90. So I guess 22 years, I'm doing hair now. Oops.  
Speaker 0    00:00:40    There's a swap about where you're from and all the places that you've lived  
Speaker 1    00:00:45    Briefly. Um, I, I, I come from Pakistan. I was born and mostly raised there and I lived in, um, Utah, um, my first, uh, four or five years in the us.  
Speaker 0    00:00:58    Where in Utah?  
Speaker 1    00:00:59    Uh, Logan, Utah.  
Speaker 0    00:01:02    Is that near salt lake or is it  
Speaker 1    00:01:03    Southern? Uh, it's near salt lake. It's about 90 miles west of salt lake city. I went to school over there.  
Speaker 0    00:01:10    So was that a culture shock?  
Speaker 1    00:01:12    Very much so, cuz it was uh it's I didn't know when I, in fact, when I was on the plane from New York to Logan, Utah, somebody asked me, you know, where you're going. I said, I know I'm going to the university in Logan, Utah, but I had no idea for me. America was all one big country. So, um, yeah, Logan, Utah was a very beautiful small town, uh, by the canyon, but I had no idea about the Mormon and it was a predominantly, a Mormon state and uh, Logan, Utah, you know, uh, the university I attended, why were I had a friend who was going school there? And he was the one who sort of motivated me, initiated me to, uh, go to university over there cuz he really liked it. And he said the school was good. And uh, so I just kind of followed him. These are very idea. And how were you? I was, I guess, uh, in my late teens, early 20, I would say maybe on the, you know,  
Speaker 0    00:02:17    And were you, um, out as a Muslim or were you, did you practice as a Muslim?  
Speaker 1    00:02:24    Yeah, I grew up, I was born as a Muslim and I I'm still a Muslim, you know. And, um,  
Speaker 0    00:02:31    Did you feel free? I mean, in terms of the Mormon culture there, did you feel like it was an issue at all or?  
Speaker 1    00:02:37    Uh, personally, frankly speaking, I never felt that of course, a few times when I was staying in the dormitory, you know, some of the, you know, the Mormon clergy or what they would and come in and invite you to visit the temple or just, you know, about the religion, the Mormon religion itself. But I never found them offensive. They were, you know, very sort of in introduction and uh, to me it was, it was perfectly fine. It was like getting to know the culture and I stayed in Logan, Utah and attended the university there, Utah state university. I graduated from there 1983. And uh, what  
Speaker 0    00:03:16    Did you study?  
Speaker 1    00:03:16    Mechanical engineering. Oh wow.  
Speaker 0    00:03:19    And so how did you become a hairdresser?  
Speaker 1    00:03:21    It was by accident. It was not never part of the plan, even though I grew up, uh, liking every aspect of, uh, beauty or uh, design or color, you know, I was very art inclined. I studied engineering because we had a family business back home in Pakistan. It was a manufacturing setup we had and me being the elder of the boys, you know, I was, uh, sort of initiated or motivated to study engineering. So I could be part of the setup.  
Speaker 0    00:03:52    Where did you go after Utah?  
Speaker 1    00:03:53    After Utah? I went to St uh, I went to a town called raw Missouri. It was a about 80 miles. Uh, I'm not about from, from St. Louis. It was a small, um, engineering sort of oriented university, university of Missouri at raw. And I did my masters over there in engineering management. It was soon after I graduated from Utah. I, I, uh, went home for a year and then after a year I was in, in Missouri and I finished my, I graduated with my masters in 86, 87.  
Speaker 0    00:04:31    Okay. And did you stay in Missouri  
Speaker 1    00:04:33    And no, I moved back home and I stayed in my country till about 1990. I was helping with the family business, uh, the manufacturing setup we had the industry we had. And also in the meantime, also in between I worked in a bank for a year or so. I had another job, uh, in an engineering firm. And then in 1990, I came back to the United States. First. I was in, uh, Arizona, then from Arizona. I was staying with my brother in Phoenix, Arizona. A friend of mine invited me to New York.
