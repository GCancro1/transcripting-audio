	Speaker 0: What's (93.00%) your (96.00%) bias (99.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: Well (47.00%), my (92.00%) bias (82.00%), like (91.00%) you (66.00%) said (97.00%), I'm (98.00%) right (99.00%) wing (100.00%). I'm (93.00%) 

	Speaker 0: What (72.00%), what (51.00%) if (99.00%) you (99.00%) had (97.00%) to (95.00%), like (96.00%), if (98.00%) you (98.00%) go (99.00%), God (72.00%) damn (57.00%), and (67.00%) maybe (99.00%) I (100.00%) went (99.00%) too (98.00%) far (100.00%) down (100.00%) this (100.00%) road (100.00%), if (99.00%) I (100.00%) could (99.00%) just (100.00%) relax (100.00%) one (100.00%) aspect (100.00%) of (100.00%) my (99.00%), my (90.00%) dialogue (86.00%), what (100.00%) would (100.00%) it (99.00%) be (100.00%) me (78.00%)? It (98.00%) would (98.00%) be (99.00%) my (99.00%) pipe (100.00%) smoking (99.00%) your (89.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Pipe (100.00%), smoking (99.00%). <laugh> (55.00%) um (96.00%), I (99.00%) probably (95.00%), you (96.00%) know (96.00%), I (99.00%) probably (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) talk (100.00%) about (64.00%) the (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) issue (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: That (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: I (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) care (79.00%) because (33.00%) here's (96.00%) the (88.00%) thing (99.00%) I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) care (100.00%) about (100.00%) it (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Or (61.00%) the (96.00%) other (96.00%), 

	Speaker 1: But (100.00%) my (100.00%) issue (100.00%) with (100.00%) it (100.00%) is (99.00%) when (99.00%) we (83.00%) still (86.00%) have (63.00%) some (69.00%) Montreal (100.00%), I (99.00%) talked (100.00%) about (100.00%) it (99.00%) when (100.00%) people (100.00%) lie (100.00%) about (100.00%) it (100.00%) and (100.00%) they're (98.00%) dishonest (100.00%) with (99.00%) their (99.00%) voting (99.00%) constituency (100.00%). Like (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: How (100.00%) so (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: Well (99.00%) saying (99.00%), you (96.00%) know (95.00%), it's (99.00%) medicine (100.00%) for (100.00%) a (81.00%), B (74.00%), C (97.00%), or (88.00%) D (96.00%), and (64.00%) maybe (63.00%) medicine (99.00%) for (100.00%) a (99.00%), but (97.00%) not (99.00%) for (99.00%) B (90.00%), C (83.00%) or (68.00%) 

	Speaker 0: D (96.00%). Well (59.00%), what (97.00%) are (87.00%) the (99.00%) BBCs (99.00%) and (98.00%) D's (95.00%), what (66.00%) are (73.00%) 

	Speaker 1: The (69.00%) things (76.00%) Wells (60.00%) about (50.00%) an (52.00%) example (69.00%)? Well (97.00%), you're (100.00%) asking (99.00%) me (99.00%) what (100.00%) I (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) talk (100.00%) about (100.00%), and (60.00%) they're (80.00%) asking (99.00%) me (99.00%) to (99.00%) defend (100.00%) it (99.00%) the (80.00%) moment (70.00%). My (65.00%) point (89.00%) is (95.00%) I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) really (99.00%) care (100.00%) about (100.00%) it (99.00%), but (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: What (99.00%) are (93.00%) the (99.00%) BCS (89.00%) and (69.00%) D (80.00%) what (81.00%) you (79.00%), you (91.00%) said (94.00%) it (60.00%), 

	Speaker 1: Uh (73.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Well (51.00%), there (88.00%) has (99.00%) been (100.00%) shown (100.00%). It (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Helps (99.00%) with (99.00%) cancer (100.00%) about (90.00%) as (96.00%) much (86.00%) as (76.00%) American (90.00%) ginger (94.00%), those (83.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Those (59.00%) anti-inflammatory (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Things (64.00%) cancer (82.00%). I (87.00%) know (90.00%), but (96.00%) it's (97.00%) not (99.00%) a (97.00%) prescription (99.00%) C (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: B (96.00%) D (91.00%) has (99.00%) been (100.00%) shown (92.00%) to (91.00%) seizures (63.00%). All (70.00%) those (56.00%) tremendous (100.00%), tremendous (99.00%) benefits (100.00%) for (99.00%) and (89.00%) non (83.00%) psychoactive (93.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yeah (97.00%). And (93.00%) certainly (97.00%) with (99.00%) seizures (100.00%), I (100.00%) have (99.00%) zero (68.00%) problem (100.00%) with (99.00%) CBD (67.00%) being (69.00%), 

	Speaker 0: But (82.00%) my (57.00%) also (88.00%) cannabis (99.00%) I'll (93.00%) have (94.00%) 

	Speaker 1: To (94.00%), yeah (94.00%). I (99.00%) feel (99.00%) the (99.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) call (100.00%) people (100.00%) out (99.00%) in (67.00%) bullshit (98.00%) when (100.00%) they (100.00%) say (100.00%), well (98.00%), the (100.00%) reason (100.00%) it's (98.00%) not (97.00%) is (50.00%) because (69.00%) of (99.00%) big (100.00%) pharmaceutical (100.00%) companies (100.00%) go (87.00%) hold (89.00%) on (69.00%) a (44.00%) second (100.00%). There's (99.00%) seven (100.00%) patents (100.00%) on (100.00%) chemical (100.00%) compounds (100.00%) from (74.00%) marijuana (100.00%) right (100.00%) now (100.00%), right (92.00%)? The (100.00%) people (100.00%) who (99.00%) stand (99.00%) to (100.00%) make (100.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) out (89.00%) of (88.00%) marijuana (100.00%), legalization (100.00%) and (41.00%) Pharmac (73.00%) companies (96.00%). That's (99.00%) why (95.00%) they (94.00%) make (63.00%), that's (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Not (97.00%) true (99.00%). Well (93.00%), 

	Speaker 1: It (99.00%) is (97.00%). If (99.00%) you (100.00%) look (99.00%) at (99.00%) the (99.00%) biggest (94.00%) supplement (99.00%) company (35.00%) that's (82.00%) owned (99.00%) by (98.00%) the (99.00%) same (99.00%) pharmaceutical (100.00%) companies (71.00%), 

	Speaker 0: But (73.00%) you (95.00%) can't (97.00%) patent (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: The (77.00%) one (89.00%) land (43.00%). Yes (97.00%), you (98.00%) can (97.00%). They (98.00%) patented (100.00%) seven (95.00%), seven (92.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Strains (93.00%) that (59.00%) G (60.00%) 

	Speaker 1: S (90.00%) no (90.00%), no (91.00%) seven (96.00%) active (94.00%) chemical (100.00%) compounds (100.00%) in (75.00%) pot (100.00%) that (99.00%) have (97.00%) been (97.00%) patented (100.00%) as (86.00%) drugs (99.00%). They've (98.00%) gone (99.00%) through (99.00%) the (99.00%) process (100.00%). There's (65.00%) one (92.00%) that's (84.00%) really (86.00%) efficient (83.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Is (49.00%) the (69.00%) point (98.00%) where (97.00%) you (99.00%) can't (100.00%) grow (99.00%) pot (100.00%). How (100.00%) would (100.00%) you (100.00%) stop (99.00%) someone (87.00%) if (97.00%) pot (87.00%) legal (97.00%), if (98.00%) pot's (96.00%) legal (98.00%), how (99.00%) would (98.00%) anyone (99.00%)? And (86.00%) if (96.00%) they (88.00%), if (95.00%) that's (100.00%) the (100.00%) truth (100.00%), that's (100.00%) a (99.00%) real (100.00%) problem (100.00%). If (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Pot (96.00%) is (99.00%) recognized (100.00%) as (100.00%) a (99.00%) medicine (100.00%), right (99.00%)? If (97.00%) pot (97.00%) is (96.00%) recognized (99.00%), there (100.00%) is (65.00%) no (99.00%) one (98.00%) who (98.00%) would (99.00%) stand (99.00%) to (98.00%) gain (97.00%) more (100.00%) than (99.00%) pharmaceutical (100.00%) companies (100.00%) by (99.00%) providing (100.00%) it (97.00%) as (94.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Medicine (96.00%). It's (80.00%) not (97.00%) necessarily (100.00%) true (100.00%). If (74.00%) people (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Allowed (95.00%) to (92.00%) grow (21.00%), it's (97.00%) not (97.00%) necessarily (99.00%) true (99.00%). I'll (99.00%) give (100.00%) you (99.00%) that (100.00%). But (99.00%) I (99.00%) also (99.00%) think (99.00%) it's (97.00%) not (99.00%) necessarily (100.00%) true (100.00%) that (97.00%) the (98.00%) re (41.00%) and (82.00%) people (99.00%) can't (99.00%) smoke (99.00%) up (98.00%) is (96.00%) because (99.00%) big (100.00%) pharma (100.00%) is (68.00%) sitting (99.00%) somewhere (100.00%). You (89.00%) know (88.00%), Martin (98.00%) strictly (20.00%) going (98.00%), oh (43.00%), let's (100.00%) make (100.00%) potty (94.00%) illegal (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: The (38.00%), well (98.00%), not (100.00%) that (98.00%) guy (88.00%). That's (98.00%) my (98.00%) only (96.00%) point (98.00%). But (99.00%) there (100.00%) are (100.00%) absolutely (100.00%) people (100.00%) who (99.00%) have (100.00%) lobbied (99.00%), as (100.00%) we (100.00%) talked (100.00%) about (100.00%) how (100.00%) the (100.00%) prison (100.00%) guard (99.00%) union (96.00%) has (98.00%) lobbied (99.00%) to (99.00%) keep (100.00%) marijuana (99.00%) illegal (100.00%). There's (96.00%) absolutely (100.00%) pharmaceutical (100.00%) companies (100.00%) have (98.00%) done (99.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) thing (99.00%). It (95.00%) was (97.00%) revealing (99.00%) the (96.00%) WikiLeaks (97.00%) memos (100.00%). See (94.00%), this (96.00%) is (84.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Where (69.00%) I (99.00%) would (74.00%) say (79.00%) it (49.00%) was (60.00%) 

	Speaker 0: About (75.00%) don't (97.00%) interrupting (100.00%) you (94.00%). Fuck (97.00%) where (95.00%) Hillary (100.00%) Clinton (100.00%) said (99.00%) that (98.00%) she's (100.00%) against (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) in (93.00%) every (97.00%) sense (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) word (99.00%) mm-hmm (91.00%) <affirmative> (90.00%) right (96.00%). You (95.00%) remember (100.00%) those (99.00%), those (91.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Leads (45.00%) trumps (65.00%) pretty (94.00%) against (90.00%) people (67.00%) 

	Speaker 0: That (90.00%) came (99.00%) out (99.00%). Yeah (96.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Is (94.00%) 

	Speaker 0: He (83.00%), he (98.00%) said (100.00%) he (99.00%) would (99.00%) leave (100.00%) it (99.00%) up (100.00%) to (99.00%) the (98.00%) states (99.00%). Yeah (88.00%). That's (100.00%) actually (99.00%) a (68.00%) constitutional (100.00%) approach (100.00%), 

	Speaker 1: But (92.00%) he's (100.00%) pretty (98.00%), he (76.00%), he (92.00%) wants (99.00%) to (100.00%) beef (100.00%) up (100.00%) the (93.00%) war (99.00%) on (99.00%) drugs (100.00%). You (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Know (100.00%) why (92.00%)? I (99.00%) bet (100.00%) someone (99.00%) slipped (97.00%) him (95.00%) up (85.00%). Pot (95.00%), cookie (86.00%) wants (90.00%) it (64.00%). He (97.00%) looked (99.00%) at (98.00%) his (100.00%) hair (100.00%) in (97.00%) the (100.00%) mirror (100.00%) and (65.00%) no (93.00%) 

	Speaker 1: TTO (61.00%). He (96.00%) doesn't (99.00%) even (99.00%) drink (93.00%). 

	Speaker 0: What (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: The (99.00%) fuck (99.00%) sold (70.00%) vodka (100.00%). Doesn't (100.00%) drink (100.00%) Donald Trump (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: It's (100.00%) crazy (100.00%). Yeah (96.00%). Ever (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: No (99.00%). He (99.00%) says (97.00%) he (94.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Colorado (82.00%) topped (93.00%) 1 billion (99.00%) in (99.00%) legal (96.00%) marijuana (100.00%) sales (99.00%) in (100.00%) 2016 (98.00%). Good (86.00%) Hola (42.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yeah (95.00%). 

	Speaker 0: HOA (62.00%), Colorado (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yeah (99.00%). But (99.00%) another (99.00%) thing (98.00%) that (96.00%) we (91.00%), we (89.00%) just (100.00%) wrote (99.00%) about (100.00%), and (96.00%) again (98.00%), people (100.00%) get (97.00%) mad (99.00%) with (97.00%) the (97.00%) we (67.00%) issue (96.00%). Well (97.00%), no (96.00%), no (95.00%) traffic (100.00%) fatalities (100.00%) regarding (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) have (91.00%) skyrocketed (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Google (99.00%) that (99.00%) cause (72.00%) that's (98.00%) nonsense (99.00%). No (67.00%), you (64.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Wrote (82.00%) about (86.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Drunk (100.00%) driving (95.00%) arrest (97.00%) of (63.00%) dropped (99.00%). What (99.00%) do (98.00%) you (99.00%) mean (99.00%) you've (85.00%) first (96.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Of (98.00%) all (94.00%), no (51.00%), I (28.00%) wrote (94.00%) about (98.00%) what (62.00%) the (89.00%) sources (64.00%) of (74.00%) the (65.00%) original (94.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Just (99.00%) because (99.00%) some (90.00%) one (85.00%) gets (100.00%) in (86.00%) an (98.00%) accident (100.00%) and (99.00%) they're (97.00%) high (99.00%). See (75.00%), hold (97.00%) on (98.00%), stop (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: No (80.00%), no (83.00%). This (75.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Way (80.00%) too (97.00%) much (91.00%). You (33.00%) need (56.00%) stop (93.00%) you (93.00%) talking (47.00%) 

	Speaker 1: In (56.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Paragraph (85.00%). No (86.00%), no (87.00%), no (78.00%), no (65.00%), no (92.00%). I (97.00%) don't (100.00%) talk (97.00%) in (52.00%) paragraphs (98.00%). I (98.00%) make (99.00%) full (97.00%) points (99.00%). If (100.00%) people (100.00%) are (98.00%) high (100.00%), a (100.00%) lot (100.00%), and (47.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) amount (100.00%) of (100.00%) fatalities (100.00%) exist (100.00%), but (100.00%) the (100.00%) people (100.00%) that (100.00%) get (100.00%) checked (100.00%) once (100.00%) they (100.00%) get (100.00%) into (100.00%) these (100.00%) accidents (100.00%) happen (91.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) high (100.00%). It (100.00%) does (100.00%) not (100.00%) necessarily (100.00%) mean (100.00%) that (99.00%) marijuana (100.00%) cause (99.00%) those (100.00%) fatalities (100.00%), it (100.00%) could (100.00%) be (100.00%) that (99.00%) you (100.00%) have (100.00%) an (99.00%) increased (100.00%) incidence (97.00%) of (100.00%) people (100.00%) doing (100.00%) marijuana (99.00%) and (98.00%) altercations (100.00%). It (79.00%) could (100.00%) not (100.00%) have (98.00%) been (100.00%) avoided (100.00%). It (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Could (100.00%) be (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: It (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Could (55.00%) be (99.00%). But (97.00%) the (99.00%) statistical (98.00%) change (100.00%) is (92.00%) measurable (100.00%). Well (97.00%), what (96.00%) is (67.00%) from (75.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Pre (72.00%) and (53.00%) you're (92.00%) talking (99.00%) about (99.00%) in (99.00%) Colorado (100.00%), 

	Speaker 1: In (96.00%) states (99.00%) where (99.00%) it's (100.00%) been (100.00%) decriminalized (100.00%),

If (98.00%) people (95.00%) wanna (93.00%) smoke (99.00%) up (96.00%) fine (100.00%). I (100.00%) just (100.00%) don't (100.00%) really (99.00%) buy (99.00%) the (100.00%) arguments (100.00%) that (99.00%) everyone (100.00%) is (97.00%) in (99.00%) some (100.00%) big (99.00%) conspiracy (100.00%) to (100.00%) try (99.00%) and (99.00%) snuff (100.00%) it (100.00%) out (99.00%). No (84.00%), 

	Speaker 0: There (82.00%) 

	Speaker 1: The (54.00%) idea (96.00%) and (91.00%) the (99.00%) idea (98.00%) that (97.00%) the (99.00%) drug (100.00%) war (100.00%) will (99.00%) end (43.00%) and (95.00%) the (98.00%) idea (99.00%) that (95.00%) it's (86.00%) it's (65.00%) cures (100.00%) cancer (99.00%). I (100.00%) just (99.00%) don't (100.00%) buy (99.00%) that (99.00%). And (78.00%) people (90.00%) get (93.00%) so (99.00%) upset (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Well (86.00%), well (83.00%) listen (98.00%), 

	Speaker 1: The (56.00%) point (70.00%). That's (89.00%) why (83.00%) I (60.00%), when (37.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Studies (56.00%) have (99.00%) proven (100.00%) that (98.00%) it (99.00%) shrinks (100.00%) tumors (100.00%), that (99.00%) it (99.00%) helps (99.00%) people (86.00%) with (100.00%) cancer (100.00%), much (100.00%) like (100.00%) tumor (67.00%) Meric (55.00%), much (97.00%) like (99.00%) any (71.00%) things (91.00%) that (99.00%) reduce (99.00%) inflammation (99.00%) and (71.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Heart (54.00%) cherry (48.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Right (86.00%). But (97.00%) it's (99.00%) not (99.00%) necessary (99.00%). They're (97.00%) all (97.00%) legal (86.00%). And (91.00%) there's (98.00%) no (96.00%) issue (100.00%) cuz (73.00%) they're (88.00%) not (99.00%) psychoactive (96.00%). Right (99.00%). But (100.00%) they (99.00%) are (89.00%) beneficial (100.00%). So (100.00%) all (100.00%) these (100.00%) things (100.00%) are (100.00%) good (100.00%). Marijuana (100.00%) is (87.00%) one (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) things (100.00%) that (99.00%) are (99.00%) good (100.00%). And (93.00%) don't (72.00%) sure (85.00%), man (99.00%), just (100.00%) like (100.00%) you (100.00%), don't (99.00%) sure (53.00%) to (83.00%) Merick (75.00%) you (99.00%) don't (100.00%) shore (63.00%) ginger (100.00%), you (100.00%) don't (100.00%) shore (60.00%) a (100.00%) reduced (93.00%) sugar (100.00%) diet (100.00%). All (100.00%) those (100.00%) things (100.00%) that (100.00%) reduce (96.00%) inflammation (100.00%) are (97.00%) good (99.00%) for (87.00%) 

	Speaker 1: You (65.00%). I (57.00%), I (91.00%) don't (86.00%), I (85.00%) don't (100.00%) buy (99.00%) that (99.00%). Smoking (99.00%) marijuana (100.00%) would (97.00%) be (100.00%) as (99.00%) beneficial (100.00%) as (96.00%) a (59.00%) reduced (89.00%) sugar (100.00%) diet (100.00%). And (98.00%) my (99.00%) point (100.00%) is (86.00%) that (80.00%) people (81.00%) might (75.00%) be (72.00%) you (55.00%) so (95.00%) offended (99.00%) saying (71.00%) and (69.00%) saying (90.00%), but (96.00%) if (98.00%) you (98.00%) wanna (93.00%) smoke (97.00%), go (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Ahead (98.00%). You (98.00%) might (98.00%) be (97.00%) correct (98.00%). Shouldn't (99.00%) be (99.00%) offended (39.00%). It (98.00%) doesn't (100.00%) matter (100.00%) because (77.00%) it's (100.00%) not (99.00%) a (97.00%) fucking (99.00%) contest (100.00%) to (98.00%) see (99.00%) what's (100.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) beneficial (100.00%). It (67.00%), the (99.00%) question (100.00%) is (99.00%), is (99.00%) it (99.00%) beneficial (100.00%)? And (100.00%) is (100.00%) it (99.00%) damaging (100.00%)? It (100.00%) is (97.00%). 

	Speaker 1: It (97.00%) does (100.00%) matter (100.00%). The (66.00%) fact (76.00%), No (93.00%), no (77.00%). Let (68.00%), lemme (69.00%) finish (99.00%) my (96.00%) point (99.00%). It (98.00%) does (99.00%) matter (99.00%). You (98.00%) said (98.00%), what (99.00%) would (100.00%) you (99.00%) not (100.00%) talk (100.00%) about (64.00%)? I (81.00%) said (99.00%) probably (99.00%) pot (88.00%). Cause (66.00%) I (99.00%) don't (100.00%) care (100.00%). Well (93.00%) what (99.00%) do (97.00%) you (98.00%) think (99.00%) about (69.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Care (82.00%)? That's (75.00%) what (60.00%) I (64.00%) think (91.00%) about (83.00%) 

	Speaker 1: It (67.00%), about (81.00%) it (78.00%). And (93.00%) your (96.00%) eyes (99.00%) light (97.00%) up (98.00%) and (95.00%) all (98.00%) of (74.00%) a (83.00%) sudden (98.00%) ideolog (25.00%) in (69.00%) world (92.00%) care (51.00%) like (79.00%) crazy (81.00%) shouldn't (98.00%) be (99.00%) discussed (97.00%). No (81.00%) you (70.00%) you're (93.00%) gonna (86.00%) laser (88.00%) in (74.00%) a (63.00%), like (96.00%) a (98.00%) tractor (98.00%) beam (98.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) important (100.00%) issue (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) day (100.00%) that (98.00%) I (100.00%) said (99.00%), I (98.00%) don't (100.00%) care (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: You're (100.00%) the (100.00%) guy (99.00%) that (95.00%) thinks (100.00%) people (100.00%) should (100.00%) be (100.00%) able (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (99.00%) whatever (97.00%). You're (94.00%) a (92.00%) free (87.00%) market (71.00%) guy (97.00%). I (79.00%) just (86.00%) said (88.00%). So (91.00%) if (95.00%) you're (96.00%) a (62.00%) free (99.00%) market (95.00%) guy (90.00%), why (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) you (99.00%) be (100.00%) support (100.00%) of (100.00%) something (97.00%)? Whether (100.00%) it's (100.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) beneficial (99.00%). I (56.00%) just (59.00%), that (56.00%) I (89.00%) am (85.00%) or (98.00%) equally (99.00%) beneficial (99.00%). I (57.00%) am (79.00%), but (99.00%) you're (99.00%) not (100.00%) necessarily (100.00%) because (73.00%) you're (82.00%) you're (82.00%) denying (96.00%) because (40.00%) denying (87.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Of (68.00%) a (81.00%) chemical (98.00%) calm (36.00%),

Since (100.00%) marijuana (99.00%) legalization (100.00%), highway (99.00%) fatalities (100.00%) in (100.00%) Colorado (98.00%), since (92.00%) you (92.00%) called (82.00%) me (82.00%) a (81.00%), 

	Speaker 1: Since (90.00%) you (79.00%) called (88.00%) me (69.00%), since (94.00%) you (91.00%) called (54.00%) me (87.00%) a (89.00%) fucking (95.00%) a (59.00%) pus (82.00%) and (87.00%) you (99.00%) do (98.00%) this (99.00%) with (99.00%) the (56.00%) crazy (99.00%) lady (97.00%) at (72.00%) comedy (99.00%)

My (98.00%) point (99.00%) is (98.00%) I (98.00%) don't (98.00%) care (93.00%) about (92.00%) it (57.00%). I (88.00%) don't (97.00%) think (99.00%) that (92.00%) if (82.00%) we (89.00%) up (61.00%) and (93.00%) you (97.00%) just (97.00%) said (96.00%) I (48.00%) was (90.00%) interrupting (100.00%), you're (99.00%) interrupting (100.00%) now (23.00%) screaming (95.00%). I (60.00%) don't (70.00%) care (60.00%) about (71.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Up (78.00%) a (89.00%) post (94.00%). You're (92.00%) not (92.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Don't (76.00%) buy (57.00%), ignoring (81.00%) it (72.00%). That (72.00%) it's (90.00%) as (96.00%) valuable (99.00%) as (96.00%) a (98.00%) low (99.00%) sugar (94.00%) diet (100.00%). And (99.00%) the (99.00%) fact (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Doesn't (96.00%) have (75.00%) to (78.00%) fact (76.00%), 

	Speaker 1: You (95.00%) can't (99.00%) have (98.00%) a (99.00%) conversation (100.00%) about (100.00%) this (100.00%) as (94.00%) civilly (95.00%) as (99.00%) you (97.00%) did (98.00%). Every (100.00%) other (100.00%) issue (100.00%) tells (100.00%) me (99.00%) that (95.00%) there's (98.00%) a (71.00%), that's (77.00%) not (87.00%), there's (88.00%) a (97.00%) problem (99.00%). This (86.00%) is (87.00%) a (96.00%) TT (98.00%) powder (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: K (67.00%) I (94.00%) can (91.00%) the (69.00%) is (90.00%) I (99.00%) get (100.00%) very (79.00%) defensive (100.00%). When (100.00%) people (100.00%) start (97.00%) talking (100.00%) over (100.00%) me (100.00%) and (100.00%) you (100.00%) start (75.00%) it (80.00%) first (100.00%). But (99.00%) the (63.00%), the (96.00%) reality (100.00%) is (100.00%) that (98.00%) a (49.00%), a (98.00%) low (98.00%) sugar (97.00%) diet (99.00%) is (97.00%) fine (100.00%). Sure (95.00%). It's (98.00%) good (100.00%) too (90.00%). But (61.00%) why (96.00%) is (99.00%) there (99.00%) a (98.00%) competition (100.00%) between (96.00%) a (96.00%) low (98.00%) your (32.00%) diet (95.00%) and (88.00%) tuber (22.00%) and (99.00%) marijuana (99.00%) and (100.00%) CBD (86.00%) oil (100.00%)? Why (100.00%), why (95.00%), why (94.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Does (81.00%), is (93.00%) making (100.00%) the (99.00%) claim (100.00%) regarding (100.00%) legality (100.00%)? That (100.00%) it (97.00%) cures (100.00%) cancer (100.00%)? My (82.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Don't (84.00%) believe (87.00%) legal (54.00%). 

	Speaker 1: No (87.00%). My (98.00%) only (96.00%) point (96.00%) is (54.00%), cause (38.00%) 

	Speaker 0: The (96.00%) other (99.00%) ones (99.00%) are (99.00%) already (99.00%) legal (86.00%). They (98.00%) don't (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Have (99.00%) to (99.00%) fight (100.00%) for (78.00%). Yeah (52.00%), but (83.00%) no (99.00%) one's (99.00%) prescribing (100.00%).

	Speaker 2: I (56.00%), I (98.00%) got (99.00%) the (99.00%) article (100.00%). I've (100.00%) been (100.00%) looking (100.00%) at (100.00%) it (98.00%) for (99.00%) like (97.00%) the (70.00%) last (99.00%) few (99.00%) minutes (99.00%) on (100.00%) your (100.00%) website (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yeah (82.00%). 

	Speaker 2: There's (99.00%) a (99.00%) couple (100.00%) statements (100.00%) that (100.00%) are (99.00%) really (100.00%) bad (100.00%). Just (99.00%) off (98.00%) the (79.00%), just (98.00%) off (98.00%) the (100.00%) gate (99.00%) like (99.00%) this (99.00%) right (99.00%) here (99.00%). If (100.00%) you (100.00%) wanna (70.00%) get (99.00%) higher (61.00%) a (86.00%) moron (98.00%). Hmm (56.00%). Well (62.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Getting (91.00%) high (61.00%), make (60.00%) you (59.00%) more (62.00%). 

	Speaker 1: That's (73.00%) not (55.00%), that's (97.00%) not (96.00%) a (92.00%) news (79.00%) article (98.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Hold (96.00%) 

	Speaker 1: On (95.00%), please (93.00%). That's (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Commentary (99.00%). Hold (97.00%) on (98.00%). But (99.00%) fine (99.00%). After (100.00%) all (99.00%) things (100.00%) like (100.00%) Coachella (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) exist (100.00%). Is (97.00%) this (99.00%) your (99.00%) article (100.00%)? Yeah (86.00%). 

	Speaker 1: I (70.00%) it's (80.00%) an (73.00%) article (98.00%) on (90.00%) my (99.00%) site (94.00%). Wait (90.00%) 

	Speaker 0: A (78.00%) minute (94.00%). If (95.00%) you (98.00%) could (47.00%) wanna (84.00%) get (91.00%) high (53.00%). You're (54.00%) what (45.00%) you're (96.00%) a (97.00%) moron (97.00%). Yeah (87.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Think (82.00%) 

	Speaker 0: You're (90.00%) a (96.00%) moron (98.00%). 

	Speaker 1: I (95.00%) think (98.00%) Courtney (93.00%) who's (93.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Courtney (98.00%) she's (90.00%) works (81.00%). 

	Speaker 1: One (98.00%) of (97.00%) the (99.00%) best (99.00%) writers (97.00%). I (99.00%) think (100.00%) I've (98.00%) ever (99.00%) encountered (100.00%). How (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Dare (100.00%) you (100.00%) not (100.00%) read (100.00%) then (94.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: But (74.00%) so (96.00%) then (86.00%) the (91.00%) article (100.00%) links (98.00%) to (99.00%) a (99.00%) couple (100.00%), uh (90.00%), like (99.00%) this (100.00%) for (100.00%) instance (99.00%) is (92.00%) one (95.00%) that (91.00%) says (99.00%) it (98.00%) has (99.00%) deadliest (100.00%) year (98.00%) of (99.00%) traffic (99.00%) fatally (100.00%) since (100.00%) 2008 (99.00%). Yeah (95.00%). This (99.00%) article (100.00%) doesn't (99.00%) say (100.00%) anything (99.00%) about (100.00%) marijuana (99.00%). Not (99.00%) one (95.00%), one (88.00%) thing (100.00%) doesn't (99.00%) mention (100.00%) me (76.00%) weed (85.00%) at (95.00%) once (100.00%). It (100.00%) does (96.00%) say (100.00%) that (99.00%) it (100.00%) could (100.00%) be (100.00%) a (97.00%) Beed (62.00%) to (92.00%) prices (96.00%), people (99.00%) driving (100.00%) more (100.00%), more (67.00%) people (99.00%) in (100.00%) the (99.00%) state (99.00%). Sure (80.00%). Cetera (69.00%), et (76.00%) cetera (73.00%). 

	Speaker 0: First (73.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Off (30.00%), that's (94.00%) not (89.00%) the (96.00%) only (91.00%) thing (89.00%). This (68.00%) is (75.00%) important (90.00%). I'm (97.00%) gonna (95.00%) defend (100.00%) myself (99.00%) here (98.00%) because (97.00%) you (99.00%) have (100.00%) someone (100.00%) here (99.00%) at (100.00%) the (99.00%) ready (86.00%). And (99.00%) what (99.00%) you (99.00%) do (99.00%) is (94.00%) instead (100.00%) of (99.00%) bringing (100.00%) up (99.00%) information (100.00%), this (100.00%) is (99.00%) what (99.00%) happens (99.00%) with (99.00%) Christopher (98.00%) ti (56.00%), right (99.00%)? You (98.00%) don't (100.00%) have (100.00%) information (100.00%) that (99.00%) you (100.00%) bring (100.00%) up (100.00%), you (100.00%) have (100.00%) another (100.00%) guy (100.00%) look (99.00%) up (94.00%) a (99.00%) source (100.00%) that (100.00%) you (100.00%) specifically (100.00%) want (100.00%) him (100.00%) to (100.00%) find (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) ask (100.00%) him (99.00%) to (99.00%) bring (99.00%) that (95.00%) up (96.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Did (76.00%) he (28.00%) just (59.00%) brought (96.00%) it (70.00%) up (77.00%)? He (56.00%) brought (99.00%) up (98.00%) Washington (100.00%) post (100.00%) and (92.00%) he (64.00%) goes (97.00%), this (99.00%) is (99.00%) what's (100.00%) wrong (100.00%) with (100.00%) your (97.00%) article (100.00%) taking (98.00%) a (94.00%) joke (95.00%). You (61.00%) 

	Speaker 0: You've (79.00%) already (68.00%) been (82.00%) talked (50.00%). You (98.00%) didn't (99.00%) have (99.00%) a (99.00%) joke (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: The (99.00%) joke (100.00%) in (99.00%) there (99.00%) about (99.00%) things (98.00%) that (57.00%) Coachella (100.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) exist (100.00%). If (100.00%) there (96.00%) weren't (99.00%) that's (78.00%) 

	Speaker 0: In (96.00%) that (98.00%) article (98.00%), that's (100.00%) 

	Speaker 1: A (99.00%) joke (100.00%). Right (96.00%)? But (87.00%) to (56.00%) triangle (54.00%), do (92.00%) you (85.00%) think (82.00%) people (98.00%) who (84.00%) smoke (100.00%) hot (56.00%) mores (69.00%)? No (99.00%). It's (100.00%) a (100.00%) joke (100.00%). Okay (92.00%). Let's (100.00%) not (100.00%) do (100.00%) that (100.00%). Okay (57.00%). Let's (100.00%) not (100.00%) do (100.00%) that (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: And (97.00%) no (95.00%) pots (99.00%) not (100.00%) comparable (100.00%) to (100.00%) alcohol (100.00%). There (100.00%) are (100.00%) tests (99.00%) that (54.00%) determine (100.00%) how (100.00%) much (100.00%) alcohol (100.00%) content (100.00%) is (99.00%) in (99.00%) your (100.00%) bloodstream (100.00%). We (99.00%) can't (100.00%) you (89.00%) do (100.00%) that (100.00%) with (100.00%) weed (100.00%). So (98.00%) it's (100.00%) impossible (100.00%) to (99.00%) handle (100.00%) these (99.00%) incidents (71.00%) in (93.00%) the (98.00%) same (100.00%) way (99.00%). That's (82.00%) but (83.00%) there (75.00%) have (62.00%), okay (86.00%). But (95.00%) there (96.00%) have (99.00%) been (99.00%) tests (94.00%) where (86.00%) they (98.00%) showed (100.00%) people (99.00%), 

	Speaker 1: But (94.00%) that (93.00%) would (94.00%) go (98.00%) back (99.00%) to (99.00%) what (98.00%) he (99.00%) said (98.00%) and (89.00%) what (87.00%) you (91.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Said (85.00%). But (81.00%) there (94.00%) have (98.00%) been (99.00%) has (42.00%) where (84.00%) they've (98.00%) shown (99.00%) people (100.00%) drunk (100.00%) versus (96.00%) on (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) and (98.00%) the (99.00%) people (100.00%) on (99.00%) marijuana (99.00%) drove (100.00%) far (100.00%) better (100.00%). Okay (96.00%). That's (100.00%) true (100.00%). So (98.00%) this (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Is (99.00%) also (99.00%) anecdotal (100.00%). No (93.00%), these (90.00%) are (94.00%) tests (65.00%). It (70.00%) goes (98.00%) back (99.00%) to (100.00%) your (100.00%) point (100.00%), right (98.00%)? Let's (98.00%) say (98.00%) someone (100.00%) has (100.00%) alcohol (99.00%) in (49.00%), are (59.00%) 

	Speaker 0: These (99.00%) tests (97.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: Well (93.00%), I (98.00%) don't (95.00%), I (76.00%) haven't (96.00%) read (100.00%) your (100.00%) tests (63.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Okay (96.00%). So (95.00%) why (89.00%) you (94.00%) arguing (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Against (98.00%) them (86.00%)? No (92.00%), I'm (99.00%) saying (99.00%) I (98.00%) agreed (75.00%) with (100.00%) your (99.00%) point (100.00%) earlier (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: So (93.00%) why (98.00%) are (92.00%) you (94.00%) saying (100.00%) they're (57.00%) anecdotal (91.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Is (77.00%) anecdotal (100.00%). If (99.00%) you're (100.00%) saying (99.00%) some (100.00%) people (100.00%) drive (100.00%) better (100.00%) on (99.00%) marijuana (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I'm (99.00%) not (100.00%) saying (100.00%) that (99.00%) I've (100.00%) said (99.00%) there (97.00%) have (53.00%) been (99.00%) tests (99.00%) where (68.00%) they've (99.00%) shown (100.00%) that (97.00%) people (99.00%) drive (86.00%) better (95.00%) on (99.00%) marijuana (100.00%) than (59.00%) alcohol (98.00%). That's (73.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Anecdotal (64.00%). My (75.00%) point (97.00%) is (93.00%), if (70.00%) you're (71.00%), you're (85.00%) looking (94.00%) to (95.00%) be (98.00%) really (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Good (98.00%) at (98.00%) this (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Argument (99.00%). No (70.00%), I'm (77.00%), I'm (79.00%) not (81.00%), you (75.00%) just (83.00%) settle (96.00%) down (96.00%). You (95.00%) said (99.00%) you (98.00%) wouldn't (99.00%) pile (99.00%) on (93.00%) and (98.00%) you (93.00%) got (97.00%) two (98.00%) people (99.00%) down (65.00%). It (48.00%) is (76.00%) talking (78.00%) When (79.00%) someone (70.00%), the (85.00%) show (80.00%), when (96.00%) someone (95.00%) comes (97.00%) on (99.00%) the (99.00%) show (100.00%), Jared (100.00%) can (38.00%), cannot (74.00%) enter (67.00%). Congratulations (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: You're (81.00%) not (93.00%) show (74.00%). And (97.00%) all (100.00%) he (100.00%) did (100.00%) was (99.00%) pull (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Up (97.00%) fucking (76.00%) inform (89.00%), bringing (99.00%) up (98.00%) information (100.00%) me (98.00%) without (98.00%) a (99.00%) laptop (99.00%). No (96.00%), he (95.00%) brought (82.00%) it (84.00%) up (87.00%). He (88.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Didn't (91.00%) about (96.00%) 

	Speaker 1: It (91.00%). You (96.00%) said (99.00%) what (99.00%) would (99.00%) be (99.00%) the (100.00%) one (100.00%) thing (99.00%) that (97.00%) you've (100.00%) changed (98.00%) your (100.00%) mind (100.00%) and (73.00%) that (59.00%) you (73.00%) problem (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: With (95.00%) two (99.00%) people (100.00%) are (96.00%) correct (99.00%). And (86.00%) you're (95.00%) incorrect (100.00%). Is (59.00%) that (100.00%) bother (99.00%) you (99.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) agree (99.00%) that (98.00%) you're (98.00%) correct (100.00%). What (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Are (97.00%) you (99.00%) talking (99.00%) about (99.00%)? You (96.00%) just (98.00%) pulled (97.00%) up (98.00%) to (32.00%) some (36.00%) statistics (99.00%) that (90.00%) show (99.00%) that (93.00%) Colorado (100.00%) has (99.00%) less (100.00%) traffic (51.00%). 

	Speaker 1: No (44.00%), no (44.00%), I (84.00%) didn't (91.00%) any (52.00%) statistics (94.00%)? No (84.00%), he (89.00%), you (78.00%) just (86.00%) said (86.00%), said (70.00%), you (73.00%), you (77.00%) just (78.00%) said (88.00%) you (83.00%) I'll (66.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Laptop (74.00%). I'll (96.00%) turn (96.00%) my (99.00%) laptop (98.00%). And (74.00%) you (94.00%) can (92.00%), you (84.00%) can (86.00%), What (56.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Is (73.00%) the (97.00%) issue (96.00%) that (97.00%) you (99.00%) would (98.00%) care (99.00%) about (99.00%)? The (99.00%) lease (69.00%) that (96.00%) you've (100.00%) changed (95.00%) your (99.00%) mind (99.00%)? I (99.00%) said (98.00%), probably (99.00%) wouldn't (100.00%) even (99.00%) talk (99.00%) about (100.00%) that (60.00%). 

	Speaker 0: That's (80.00%) that's (99.00%) a (100.00%) long (100.00%) version (100.00%) of (99.00%) what (100.00%) you (55.00%) said (99.00%) and (67.00%) you (87.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Said (64.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Well (89.00%), why (89.00%) was (87.00%) there (100.00%) been (99.00%) more (100.00%) fatalities (100.00%) since (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) has (100.00%) been (100.00%) legal (100.00%) in (99.00%) those (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: States (93.00%), in (43.00%) all (99.00%) the (99.00%) things (100.00%) we've (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Discussed (100.00%), that's (98.00%) not (99.00%) true (99.00%). Why (100.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Are (100.00%) you (100.00%) so (100.00%) obsessed (100.00%) with (100.00%) the (93.00%) pot (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Issue (67.00%)? Because (92.00%) you're (100.00%) not (100.00%) right (100.00%). And (100.00%) it (100.00%) doesn't (100.00%) matter (100.00%) if (100.00%) we've (100.00%) talked (100.00%) about (100.00%) it (99.00%) for (100.00%) four (100.00%) hours (99.00%). So (76.00%) in (99.00%) this (100.00%) instance (100.00%) you (99.00%) are (98.00%) incorrect (100.00%). You (99.00%) know (99.00%), you're (63.00%) 

	Speaker 1: No (55.00%), I'm (95.00%) not (96.00%) incorrect (98.00%). In (97.00%) that (99.00%) instance (99.00%), the (73.00%) traffic (99.00%) fatal (100.00%) have (91.00%) increased (100.00%) in (90.00%) areas (98.00%) where (93.00%) pot (99.00%) of (41.00%) increased (99.00%). We (100.00%) did (99.00%) the (94.00%) same (100.00%) study (99.00%) in (99.00%) Michigan (100.00%), where (98.00%) pot (100.00%) was (99.00%) legalized (100.00%) and (98.00%) people (99.00%) were (95.00%) actually (99.00%), uh (72.00%), wait (82.00%) a (90.00%) minute (88.00%), selling (88.00%) more (97.00%) marijuana (99.00%), underage (100.00%) kids (100.00%). I (97.00%) don't (99.00%) care (97.00%) if (53.00%) they (60.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Doesn't (90.00%) have (98.00%) anything (99.00%) to (98.00%) do (97.00%) with (98.00%) traffic (90.00%) fatalities (94.00%) to (47.00%) do (85.00%) with (93.00%) it (61.00%). It (97.00%) doesn't (99.00%) have (99.00%) anything (100.00%) to (99.00%) do (98.00%) with (99.00%) traffic (87.00%) fatalities (100.00%), unless (100.00%) you (99.00%) can (85.00%) prove (99.00%) there's (97.00%) more (100.00%) traffic (95.00%) fatalities (100.00%) than (66.00%) underage (100.00%) kids (100.00%). Since (100.00%) marijuana (100.00%) has (49.00%) been (100.00%) legal (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yeah (98.00%). There (98.00%) have (68.00%) been (100.00%) several (100.00%) articles (100.00%) that (100.00%) have (99.00%) made (100.00%) that (100.00%) claim (100.00%) made (100.00%) that (100.00%) assertion (100.00%) let's (98.00%) find (63.00%) written (88.00%) about (97.00%) it (95.00%). Let's (98.00%) find (97.00%) them (96.00%). 

	Speaker 2: They (99.00%) all (100.00%) come (100.00%) from (100.00%) one (100.00%) article (100.00%) mostly (99.00%). And (95.00%) it's (97.00%) from (99.00%) this (79.00%), these (74.00%) AAA (61.00%) staff (66.00%), and (94.00%) this (96.00%) is (96.00%) the (98.00%) stats (99.00%) that (94.00%) they (99.00%) said (98.00%). And (83.00%) it's (63.00%) most (42.00%), almost (46.00%) all (98.00%) the (98.00%) articles (100.00%) you're (99.00%) talking (100.00%) about (100.00%). Come (98.00%) from (100.00%) this (100.00%) one (100.00%) article (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Okay (92.00%)? 

	Speaker 0: Okay (95.00%). So (85.00%) this (88.00%) is (87.00%) the (95.00%) percentage (100.00%) of (100.00%) drivers (99.00%) involved (100.00%) in (98.00%) fatal (100.00%) crashes (100.00%) who (100.00%) recently (100.00%) used (83.00%) marijuana (100.00%) more (100.00%) than (100.00%) doubled (100.00%) from (100.00%) eight (99.00%) to (98.00%) 17% (99.00%), from (100.00%) 2014 (99.00%) or (87.00%) 2013 (89.00%), 2014 (92.00%), one (98.00%) in (96.00%) six (99.00%) drivers (99.00%) involved (100.00%) in (98.00%) fatal (100.00%) crashes (100.00%) from (100.00%) 2014 (98.00%) had (100.00%) recently (100.00%) used (99.00%) marijuana (99.00%), which (100.00%) is (100.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) recent (100.00%) data (98.00%) available (100.00%). Now (100.00%) you (99.00%) understand (99.00%) that (59.00%) increases (85.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Involv (85.00%) marijuana (93.00%) correlation (57.00%) is (80.00%) alarming (90.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Yeah (91.00%). It (61.00%) says (94.00%) who (99.00%), that's (98.00%) 

	Speaker 2: An (92.00%) opinion (98.00%). 

	Speaker 0: It's (99.00%) an (99.00%) opinion (100.00%), 

	Speaker 1: President (83.00%) you (41.00%) triple (52.00%) a (23.00%) foundation (99.00%). Yeah (68.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Says (72.00%) it's (93.00%) alarming (100.00%). Well (97.00%), is (89.00%) that (93.00%), is (92.00%) that (99.00%) a (100.00%) matter (100.00%) of (100.00%) more (100.00%) people (100.00%) smoking (75.00%) marijuana (100.00%) because (99.00%) it's (100.00%) legal (98.00%) or (99.00%) it's (78.00%) a (72.00%), is (89.00%) it (92.00%) a (99.00%) matter (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (84.00%) marijuana (99.00%) causing (100.00%) these (99.00%) accidents (98.00%) is (74.00%) 

	Speaker 1: An (72.00%) article (97.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Put (96.00%) out (94.00%) by (90.00%), do (52.00%) you (93.00%) know (91.00%) what (98.00%) else (99.00%) is (97.00%) true (99.00%)? Do (96.00%) you (99.00%) know (99.00%) what (99.00%) else (99.00%) is (98.00%) true (100.00%)? That (98.00%) all (100.00%) these (99.00%) people (99.00%) also (99.00%) had (97.00%) alcohol (100.00%) in (99.00%) their (95.00%) system (93.00%). Do (98.00%) you (100.00%) know (99.00%) that (100.00%)? Well (97.00%), 

	Speaker 1: No (95.00%). I (82.00%), we (94.00%) don't (99.00%) know (96.00%) that (97.00%) all (99.00%) of (74.00%) them (44.00%) alcohol (97.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Well (66.00%), a (54.00%) giant (99.00%) percentage (100.00%) of (62.00%) people (89.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Just (71.00%) made (71.00%) assumption (94.00%) said (46.00%), you (96.00%) know (96.00%), this (93.00%) be (73.00%) true (80.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I (45.00%), this (72.00%), 

	Speaker 1: Because (56.00%) ive (82.00%) read (94.00%) these (83.00%), them (31.00%) had (95.00%) alcohol (99.00%) in (97.00%) their (98.00%) system (93.00%). You (64.00%) prove (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: A (96.00%) lot (97.00%) of (96.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Them (78.00%) rewind (100.00%). The (100.00%) tape (99.00%) made (57.00%). 

	Speaker 0: They (69.00%) did (82.00%) say (93.00%) all (94.00%) a (99.00%) lot (100.00%) of (100.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Them (96.00%). Well (96.00%), you (99.00%) made (98.00%) a (99.00%) lot (98.00%) of (96.00%) assumptions (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Let's (98.00%) find (95.00%) out (95.00%) 

	Speaker 2: It (95.00%) doesn't (99.00%) say (99.00%) anything (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) article (100.00%) about (99.00%) alcohol (100.00%) though (98.00%). And (98.00%) for (100.00%) sure (100.00%) they (98.00%) should (98.00%) have (71.00%) tested (100.00%) that (97.00%) and (93.00%) put (92.00%) 

	Speaker 1: For (89.00%) sure (93.00%) they (97.00%) can't (99.00%) test (91.00%) for (65.00%) how (64.00%) many (60.00%) people (73.00%) smoke (70.00%) up (81.00%) a (94.00%) joint (99.00%), just (93.00%) Google (86.00%). What (55.00%) does (81.00%) that (62.00%) do (67.00%) with (60.00%) anything (80.00%)? It (65.00%) makes (97.00%) a (88.00%) point (99.00%) that (98.00%) you're (99.00%) gonna (99.00%) have (100.00%) an (99.00%) obvious (100.00%) position (100.00%) that (100.00%) would (100.00%) disagree (100.00%) with (100.00%) this (100.00%) one (100.00%) single (100.00%) article (100.00%). So (100.00%) if (100.00%) I (100.00%) can (99.00%) finish (100.00%) a (93.00%) point (100.00%), you've (100.00%) talked (100.00%) about (100.00%) interruption (100.00%), let (98.00%) me (96.00%) finish (100.00%) the (99.00%) one (100.00%) point (100.00%) that (99.00%) I'm (100.00%) making (100.00%). Well (62.00%), you've (84.00%) proven (72.00%) for (48.00%) marijuana (97.00%). You've (97.00%) already (96.00%) been (68.00%) proven (94.00%) test (31.00%) for (65.00%) marijuana (99.00%) roadside (97.00%). Right (97.00%)? Can (91.00%) 

	Speaker 0: We (85.00%) agree (72.00%)? No (44.00%), you (93.00%) absolutely (95.00%) can (96.00%). You (69.00%) can (68.00%) new (71.00%) tests (53.00%). Okay (56.00%). There's (91.00%) new (91.00%) tests (68.00%). Let's (94.00%) find (77.00%) enough (47.00%) before (98.00%) you (84.00%), 

	Speaker 1: You (80.00%) do (82.00%) that (72.00%), but (46.00%) they (53.00%) didn't (92.00%) test (64.00%). Like (78.00%) you (98.00%) said (97.00%), how (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Many (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%), how (95.00%) many (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) marijuana (99.00%) related (79.00%) fatalities (99.00%) also (100.00%) involved (88.00%) alcohol (100.00%)? Cuz (75.00%) it's (100.00%) a (100.00%) massively (100.00%) significant (100.00%) percentage (100.00%). Yeah (90.00%). So (100.00%) you (100.00%) can't (100.00%) necessarily (100.00%) say (100.00%) that (98.00%) just (99.00%) because (100.00%) they (100.00%) have (96.00%) these (100.00%) new (100.00%) tests (98.00%) for (81.00%) marijuana (99.00%), especially (100.00%) road (100.00%) size (65.00%). Now (35.00%) 

	Speaker 1: That's (96.00%) the (98.00%) problem (100.00%) is (97.00%) you (91.00%) can't (94.00%) okay (96.00%). I'll (100.00%) tell (100.00%) you (99.00%) what (99.00%), I'll (100.00%) give (100.00%) you (100.00%) that (100.00%). What (99.00%) do (96.00%) you (99.00%) give (95.00%)? Let (71.00%), let (64.00%) let's (100.00%) say (100.00%) you're (99.00%) correct (100.00%), but (80.00%) here's (99.00%) the (98.00%) thing (96.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Physiologically (100.00%). It (100.00%) doesn't (100.00%) have (100.00%) an (100.00%) effect (95.00%) on (100.00%) motor (100.00%) skills (97.00%) the (100.00%) way (100.00%) alcohol (100.00%) does (100.00%) or (77.00%) it (99.00%) doesn't (100.00%) slow (100.00%) down (100.00%) your (100.00%) response (100.00%) time (100.00%). Well (97.00%), I (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Know (96.00%) that (83.00%) we've (75.00%) we've (72.00%), we've (97.00%) had (95.00%) several (100.00%) doctors (99.00%) in (95.00%) the (99.00%) show (100.00%), two (100.00%) of (100.00%) whom (99.00%) had (93.00%) differing (98.00%) opinions (100.00%) on (99.00%) that (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: They (98.00%) don't (99.00%) have (99.00%) to (99.00%) be (99.00%) right (99.00%). They (94.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Don't (95.00%) have (75.00%) 

	Speaker 0: To (64.00%) be (71.00%) right (62.00%) opinions (96.00%) of (97.00%) it (96.00%). Do (98.00%) they (94.00%) opinions (67.00%) one (18.00%) themselves (99.00%)? Do (97.00%) they (96.00%) know (99.00%) what (97.00%) it's (97.00%) like (55.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Into (67.00%) this (82.00%)? This (77.00%) whole (60.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Different (76.00%) C (82.00%) BS (74.00%) news (98.00%) caught (91.00%) blatantly (100.00%) distorting (100.00%) cannabis (100.00%) study (56.00%) says (97.00%) legal (78.00%) doubles (95.00%), fatal (100.00%) car (77.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Crash (62.00%) from (94.00%) mini (87.00%) press (69.00%) news (98.00%) min (80.00%) press (65.00%) news (98.00%). So (98.00%) again (99.00%), we (100.00%) can (99.00%) go (99.00%) into (94.00%) questioning (100.00%) sources (99.00%) all (100.00%) day (100.00%) long (100.00%). If (99.00%) you (99.00%) have (99.00%) someone (99.00%) else (98.00%) bringing (99.00%) up (95.00%) sources (75.00%), don't (89.00%) think (73.00%) this (97.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Is (96.00%) a (97.00%) good (99.00%) source (98.00%). You (70.00%) think (56.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Maybe (64.00%) it (63.00%), maybe (68.00%) it (93.00%) is (86.00%). Let's (97.00%) say (84.00%) you're (80.00%) right (64.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Crowder (69.00%). But (90.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Let's (92.00%) say (80.00%) you're (60.00%) well (70.00%), lot (43.00%) of (51.00%) are (27.00%) sources (69.00%) up (87.00%) to (95.00%) something (100.00%) else (100.00%) I (99.00%) know (99.00%). And (94.00%) sources (69.00%) look (42.00%) on (97.00%) one (97.00%) issue (99.00%). And (98.00%) you (98.00%) said (97.00%), hold (91.00%) on (87.00%), what's (98.00%) the (99.00%) issue (99.00%). You (99.00%) don't (99.00%) care (98.00%). 

	Speaker 2: I (50.00%) have (87.00%) your (97.00%) sources (98.00%) right (98.00%) here (99.00%). I've (99.00%) looked (99.00%) them (97.00%) up (99.00%). There's (100.00%) people (100.00%) online (99.00%). Also (100.00%) sourcing (99.00%) them (99.00%). They (100.00%) are (99.00%) skewed (100.00%). You're (99.00%) skewing (100.00%) them (99.00%) to (99.00%) make (97.00%). And (85.00%) 

	Speaker 1: So (35.00%) the (93.00%) Washington (99.00%) post (100.00%) study (87.00%) that (99.00%) you (99.00%) skewed (99.00%), but (96.00%) 

	Speaker 0: You're (100.00%) not (100.00%) the (100.00%) Washington (100.00%) post (100.00%). You're (99.00%) supposed (99.00%) to (100.00%) be (99.00%) the (100.00%) answer (100.00%) to (99.00%) the (99.00%) Washington (100.00%) post (75.00%) post (100.00%). I'm (96.00%) not (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: The (99.00%) answer (97.00%) to (77.00%) the (99.00%) Washington (100.00%) post (97.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Don't (95.00%) say (62.00%) that (81.00%) someone's (98.00%) evil (100.00%). So (98.00%) I'm (95.00%) evil (97.00%) to (89.00%), 

	Speaker 1: Well (90.00%) you (100.00%) just (99.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Said (99.00%) that (98.00%), that (69.00%) what (92.00%) you're (97.00%) saying (96.00%), 

	Speaker 1: That's (93.00%) the (95.00%) argument (99.00%) that (89.00%) you (99.00%) just (94.00%) made (56.00%). No (98.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I (99.00%) didn't (99.00%) make (96.00%) that (93.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Argument (85.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Argument (97.00%). You (90.00%) just (97.00%) said (98.00%), come (90.00%) 

	Speaker 1: On (85.00%), man (97.00%). You (77.00%) just (97.00%) made (99.00%) that (99.00%) argument (100.00%). And (99.00%) all (100.00%) of (90.00%) a (82.00%) sudden (100.00%), when (99.00%) someone (100.00%) mentions (100.00%) pot (95.00%), you (90.00%) put (95.00%) on (81.00%) idiot (38.00%) or (55.00%) your (94.00%) worldview (97.00%), the (56.00%) lens (91.00%) of (97.00%) 

	Speaker 0: We (84.00%), no (81.00%). 

	Speaker 1: And (59.00%) you (79.00%) upset (74.00%), upset (94.00%), 

	Speaker 0: You (68.00%) get (80.00%) opinion (77.00%). Bullshit (96.00%) has (88.00%) nothing (97.00%) to (98.00%) do (95.00%) with (96.00%) weed (86.00%), 

	Speaker 1: But (54.00%) you (93.00%) haven't (96.00%) made (74.00%) an (85.00%) argument (77.00%). I (88.00%) haven't (96.00%) made (98.00%) an (96.00%) argument (99.00%). You (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Said (95.00%) 

	Speaker 1: We (93.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Showed (94.00%)
