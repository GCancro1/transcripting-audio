	Speaker 0: Hello (92.00%) everyone (98.00%) today (98.00%), I'm (99.00%) gonna (91.00%) be (99.00%) talking (99.00%) a (99.00%) little (100.00%) bit (99.00%) about (99.00%) why (99.00%) you (100.00%) should (100.00%) recycle (100.00%). So (100.00%) I (100.00%) recycle (99.00%) at (100.00%) my (100.00%) house (100.00%), uh (60.00%), here (100.00%) in (100.00%) Columbus (100.00%) and (100.00%) I (100.00%) try (99.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%) it (100.00%) as (100.00%) much (100.00%) as (100.00%) possible (100.00%) when (95.00%) I'm (97.00%) on (97.00%) campus (99.00%) and (97.00%) I (100.00%) have (100.00%) any (99.00%) waste (99.00%). So (100.00%) in (62.00%) talking (100.00%) about (100.00%) recycling (100.00%), it (100.00%) brings (100.00%) up (99.00%) the (100.00%) issue (100.00%) of (100.00%) waste (100.00%) and (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) us (78.00%), most (100.00%) of (100.00%) our (100.00%) waste (100.00%) goes (100.00%) to (100.00%) landfills (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (100.00%) very (100.00%) problematic (100.00%). So (100.00%) I'm (100.00%) gonna (99.00%) be (100.00%) talking (100.00%) a (100.00%) little (100.00%) bit (99.00%) about (100.00%) the (100.00%) issues (100.00%) of (100.00%) landfills (100.00%), why (99.00%) you (99.00%) should (100.00%) recycle (100.00%) and (100.00%) how (100.00%) this (100.00%) can (99.00%) replace (100.00%) the (100.00%) need (100.00%) for (100.00%) landfills (100.00%) and (100.00%) how (100.00%) to (99.00%) recycle (100.00%). So (100.00%), first (100.00%) of (100.00%) all (100.00%), landfills (100.00%) are (100.00%) very (99.00%) costly (99.00%) on (98.00%), it (85.00%) costs (73.00%) $30 (88.00%) to (99.00%) recycle (100.00%) trash (99.00%), but (100.00%) it (99.00%) costs (85.00%) $50 (97.00%) to (99.00%) send (100.00%) it (92.00%) to (94.00%) the (99.00%) landfill (99.00%) and (96.00%) even (100.00%) more (99.00%) expensive (99.00%), $80 (97.00%) to (99.00%) incinerate (100.00%) it (94.00%) and (96.00%) recyclable (100.00%) materials (100.00%) in (99.00%) the (99.00%) us (78.00%) waste (95.00%) stream (92.00%) would (82.00%) generate (100.00%) over (100.00%) $7 billion (56.00%) a (98.00%) year (100.00%) if (74.00%) they (98.00%) were (91.00%) recycle (100.00%) instead (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: And (95.00%) not (99.00%) only (100.00%) this (93.00%) landfills (98.00%) are (97.00%) very (99.00%) waste (93.00%). So (100.00%) plastic (99.00%) bags (99.00%) on (69.00%) loan (60.00%) generate (82.00%) over (99.00%) 300,000 (96.00%) tons (98.00%) of (99.00%) Franta (13.00%) waste (100.00%) on (99.00%) an (92.00%) annual (100.00%) basis (100.00%). One (98.00%) third (44.00%) of (99.00%) the (99.00%) average (99.00%) dump (92.00%) is (100.00%) soy (94.00%) packing (77.00%) material (100.00%). And (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (99.00%) currently (100.00%) recycles (100.00%) only (99.00%) 32% (96.00%) of (100.00%) its (100.00%) waste (99.00%). This (99.00%) is (97.00%) retrieved (99.00%) from (100.00%) the (98.00%) Y (63.00%) university (100.00%). So (99.00%) why (99.00%) you (96.00%) should (100.00%) recycle (100.00%), like (99.00%) I (99.00%) said (99.00%), it (75.00%) eliminates (95.00%) need (99.00%) for (100.00%) landfills (100.00%) and (100.00%) incinerators (93.00%), but (99.00%) it (100.00%) also (100.00%) brings (100.00%) about (99.00%) many (98.00%) conservation (99.00%) benefits (99.00%). So (99.00%) in (99.00%) cutting (96.00%) down (99.00%) the (51.00%) trees (91.00%), you're (99.00%) conserving (99.00%) wildlife (99.00%) habitat (100.00%). You're (100.00%) also (100.00%) preserving (100.00%) water (100.00%) sources (99.00%) and (100.00%) non-renewable (99.00%) mineral (100.00%) sources (100.00%) here (37.00%) also (99.00%) produce (66.00%) reducing (100.00%) pollution (100.00%) and (100.00%) reversing (100.00%) climate (100.00%) change (100.00%). But (100.00%) recycling (100.00%) also (99.00%) comes (100.00%) with (99.00%) economic (99.00%) benefits (100.00%). So (99.00%) it (98.00%) lowers (99.00%) the (99.00%) cost (98.00%) of (99.00%) energy (99.00%) to (99.00%) run (99.00%) landfills (98.00%) and (89.00%) incinerators (98.00%). And (99.00%) in (99.00%) a (99.00%) recycling (100.00%) economic (99.00%) information (98.00%) study (98.00%) conducted (100.00%) by (100.00%) the (99.00%) environmental (100.00%) protection (99.00%) agency (98.00%). It (99.00%) was (99.00%) noted (100.00%) that (99.00%) 757,000 (64.00%) jobs (100.00%), 36.6 billion (96.00%) in (99.00%) wages (100.00%) and (100.00%) 6.7 billion (98.00%) in (99.00%) tax (100.00%) revenue (100.00%) were (99.00%) created (100.00%) just (100.00%) from (100.00%) recycling (100.00%) based (75.00%) activities (100.00%) in (100.00%) one (100.00%) year (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: So (100.00%) that (100.00%) shows (98.00%) just (100.00%) how (100.00%) important (100.00%) of (100.00%) an (99.00%) operation (100.00%) it (99.00%) is (92.00%). So (100.00%) a (94.00%) common (98.00%) misconception (100.00%) is (78.00%) about (100.00%) recycling (100.00%). Well (99.00%), okay (99.00%). It (99.00%) takes (99.00%) too (99.00%) much (100.00%) time (100.00%). It's (99.00%) just (100.00%) an (99.00%) inconvenient (100.00%) thing (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%). It's (100.00%) really (99.00%) not (100.00%). As (100.00%) long (100.00%) as (100.00%) you're (99.00%) a (100.00%) Columbus (100.00%) city (100.00%) resident (100.00%) and (100.00%) you (100.00%) live (100.00%) in (100.00%) a (100.00%) single (100.00%) family (66.00%) home (100.00%) or (100.00%) apartment (100.00%) that (100.00%) uses (100.00%) city (99.00%) of (100.00%) Columbus (100.00%) trash (100.00%), who (60.00%) are (97.00%) able (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) eligible (100.00%) for (100.00%) a (100.00%) recycling (100.00%) bin (94.00%). So (100.00%) you (100.00%) can (100.00%) just (100.00%) call (100.00%) the (100.00%) Columbus (100.00%) department (100.00%) of (100.00%) public (100.00%) service (100.00%) and (96.00%) it (70.00%) will (79.00%) hook (100.00%) you (100.00%) up (100.00%) with (100.00%) a (100.00%) new (100.00%) fin (89.00%) that (99.00%) you (100.00%) can (100.00%) use (100.00%). And (99.00%) it's (100.00%) collected (100.00%) every (100.00%) two (100.00%) weeks (100.00%). This (90.00%) is (93.00%) according (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) Columbus (99.00%) public (99.00%) service (99.00%) website (100.00%) and (99.00%) items (99.00%) that (98.00%) you (100.00%) can (99.00%) recycle (100.00%). I'm (99.00%) sure (100.00%) most (85.00%) you (99.00%) are (90.00%) aware (100.00%) of (100.00%) these (99.00%), but (100.00%) these (71.00%) are (91.00%) some (98.00%) particularly (99.00%) important (100.00%) ones (100.00%) because (96.00%) they're (100.00%) so (100.00%) common (100.00%). And (43.00%) this (99.00%) includes (100.00%) a (59.00%) aluminum (100.00%) cans (100.00%), plastic (100.00%) bottles (100.00%) you (60.00%) can (99.00%) use (100.00%) now (51.00%) instead (100.00%) to (99.00%) eliminate (98.00%) the (99.00%) need (96.00%) for (99.00%) plastic (100.00%) bottles (100.00%) at (99.00%) all (100.00%) newspapers (97.00%) magazine (99.00%) paper (77.00%), everyone (99.00%) gets (100.00%) papers (89.00%) that (100.00%) they (100.00%) don't (100.00%) actually (100.00%) end (100.00%) up (100.00%) using (100.00%). And (100.00%) typically (100.00%) they're (99.00%) just (96.00%) thrown (60.00%) away (99.00%) and (93.00%) steel (99.00%) cans (98.00%) and (93.00%) glass (100.00%) containers (100.00%). And (85.00%) this (100.00%) is (99.00%) from (100.00%) the (99.00%) care (47.00%) two (60.00%) website (100.00%). And (100.00%) so (100.00%), um (97.00%), in (100.00%) conclusion (100.00%), it's (100.00%) noted (100.00%) that (100.00%) landfills (100.00%) are (96.00%) costly (100.00%) and (100.00%) wasteful (99.00%). They (100.00%) are (97.00%), are (76.00%) not (98.00%) necessary (100.00%) and (100.00%) recycling (100.00%) could (97.00%) easily (100.00%) replace (100.00%) them (92.00%). The (100.00%) earth (100.00%) is (98.00%) not (100.00%) a (99.00%) renewable (100.00%) resource (100.00%) in (100.00%) itself (100.00%). So (100.00%) if (100.00%) everyone (100.00%) did (100.00%) their (99.00%) part (100.00%), it (100.00%) would (100.00%) be (100.00%) much (100.00%) better (100.00%) off (99.00%), um (80.00%), for (100.00%) the (100.00%) future (100.00%). And (95.00%) I (100.00%) hope (100.00%) this (100.00%) has (100.00%) motivated (100.00%) you (100.00%) to (100.00%) go (100.00%) out (100.00%) and (100.00%) recycle (100.00%) if (100.00%) you (100.00%) don't (100.00%) already (99.00%). Thank (100.00%) you (100.00%).
