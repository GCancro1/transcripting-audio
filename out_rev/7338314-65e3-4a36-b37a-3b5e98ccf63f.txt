Speaker 0    00:00:00    What's your bias?  
Speaker 1    00:00:00    Well, my bias, like you said, I'm right wing. I'm  
Speaker 0    00:00:02    What, what if you had to, like, if you go, God damn, and maybe I went too far down this road, if I could just relax one aspect of my, my dialogue, what would it be me? It would be my pipe smoking your  
Speaker 1    00:00:14    Pipe, smoking. <laugh> um, I probably, you know, I probably wouldn't talk about the marijuana issue  
Speaker 0    00:00:19    That  
Speaker 1    00:00:20    I wouldn't care because here's the thing I don't care about it  
Speaker 0    00:00:24    Or the other,  
Speaker 1    00:00:25    But my issue with it is when we still have some Montreal, I talked about it when people lie about it and they're dishonest with their voting constituency. Like  
Speaker 0    00:00:32    How so?  
Speaker 1    00:00:33    Well saying, you know, it's medicine for a, B, C, or D, and maybe medicine for a, but not for B, C or  
Speaker 0    00:00:37    D. Well, what are the BBCs and D's, what are  
Speaker 1    00:00:39    The things Wells about an example? Well, you're asking me what I wouldn't talk about, and they're asking me to defend it the moment. My point is I don't really care about it, but  
Speaker 0    00:00:45    What are the BCS and D what you, you said it,  
Speaker 1    00:00:49    Uh,  
Speaker 0    00:00:49    Well, there has been shown. It  
Speaker 1    00:00:51    Helps with cancer about as much as American ginger, those,  
Speaker 0    00:00:54    Those anti-inflammatory  
Speaker 1    00:00:55    Things cancer. I know, but it's not a prescription C  
Speaker 0    00:00:57    B D has been shown to seizures. All those tremendous, tremendous benefits for and non psychoactive.  
Speaker 1    00:01:03    Yeah. And certainly with seizures, I have zero problem with CBD being,  
Speaker 0    00:01:06    But my also cannabis I'll have  
Speaker 1    00:01:08    To, yeah. I feel the need to call people out in bullshit when they say, well, the reason it's not is because of big pharmaceutical companies go hold on a second. There's seven patents on chemical compounds from marijuana right now, right? The people who stand to make the most out of marijuana, legalization and Pharmac companies. That's why they make, that's  
Speaker 0    00:01:23    Not true. Well,  
Speaker 1    00:01:24    It is. If you look at the biggest supplement company that's owned by the same pharmaceutical companies,  
Speaker 0    00:01:27    But you can't patent  
Speaker 1    00:01:27    The one land. Yes, you can. They patented seven, seven  
Speaker 0    00:01:31    Strains that G  
Speaker 1    00:01:33    S no, no seven active chemical compounds in pot that have been patented as drugs. They've gone through the process. There's one that's really efficient  
Speaker 0    00:01:40    Is the point where you can't grow pot. How would you stop someone if pot legal, if pot's legal, how would anyone? And if they, if that's the truth, that's a real problem. If  
Speaker 1    00:01:50    Pot is recognized as a medicine, right? If pot is recognized, there is no one who would stand to gain more than pharmaceutical companies by providing it as  
Speaker 0    00:01:56    Medicine. It's not necessarily true. If people  
Speaker 1    00:01:58    Allowed to grow, it's not necessarily true. I'll give you that. But I also think it's not necessarily true that the re and people can't smoke up is because big pharma is sitting somewhere. You know, Martin strictly going, oh, let's make potty illegal.  
Speaker 0    00:02:08    The, well, not that guy. That's my only point. But there are absolutely people who have lobbied, as we talked about how the prison guard union has lobbied to keep marijuana illegal. There's absolutely pharmaceutical companies have done the same thing. It was revealing the WikiLeaks memos. See, this is  
Speaker 1    00:02:23    Where I would say it was  
Speaker 0    00:02:24    About don't interrupting you. Fuck where Hillary Clinton said that she's against marijuana in every sense of the word mm-hmm <affirmative> right. You remember those, those  
Speaker 1    00:02:31    Leads trumps pretty against people  
Speaker 0    00:02:32    That came out. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:02:33    Is  
Speaker 0    00:02:33    He, he said he would leave it up to the states. Yeah. That's actually a constitutional approach,  
Speaker 1    00:02:37    But he's pretty, he, he wants to beef up the war on drugs. You  
Speaker 0    00:02:40    Know why? I bet someone slipped him up. Pot, cookie wants it. He looked at his hair in the mirror and no  
Speaker 1    00:02:44    TTO. He doesn't even drink.  
Speaker 0    00:02:45    What  
Speaker 1    00:02:46    The fuck sold vodka. Doesn't drink Donald Trump.  
Speaker 0    00:02:48    It's crazy. Yeah. Ever.  
Speaker 1    00:02:50    No. He says he  
Speaker 0    00:02:52    Colorado topped 1 billion in legal marijuana sales in 2016. Good Hola.  
Speaker 1    00:02:57    Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:02:58    HOA, Colorado.  
Speaker 1    00:02:59    Yeah. But another thing that we, we just wrote about, and again, people get mad with the we issue. Well, no, no traffic fatalities regarding marijuana have skyrocketed  
Speaker 0    00:03:08    Google that cause that's nonsense. No, you  
Speaker 1    00:03:10    Wrote about  
Speaker 0    00:03:11    Drunk driving arrest of dropped. What do you mean you've first  
Speaker 1    00:03:14    Of all, no, I wrote about what the sources of the original,  
Speaker 0    00:03:17    Just because some one gets in an accident and they're high. See, hold on, stop.  
Speaker 1    00:03:22    No, no. This  
Speaker 0    00:03:24    Way too much. You need stop you talking  
Speaker 1    00:03:25    In  
Speaker 0    00:03:25    Paragraph. No, no, no, no, no. I don't talk in paragraphs. I make full points. If people are high, a lot, and the same amount of fatalities exist, but the people that get checked once they get into these accidents happen to be high. It does not necessarily mean that marijuana cause those fatalities, it could be that you have an increased incidence of people doing marijuana and altercations. It could not have been avoided. It  
Speaker 1    00:03:53    Could be.  
Speaker 0    00:03:54    It  
Speaker 1    00:03:54    Could be. But the statistical change is measurable. Well, what is from  
Speaker 0    00:03:57    Pre and you're talking about in Colorado,  
Speaker 1    00:03:59    In states where it's been decriminalized,  
Speaker 0    00:04:01    Let's go with Colorado. Pull it up,  
Speaker 1    00:04:02    Jamie on second, you just said, let me make my point again. My point is I don't care about it. Yeah, you do. No, I really don't. You  
Speaker 0    00:04:08    Don't care about you  
Speaker 1    00:04:10    Get so touchy about it. Cuz someone says, you know, what? If people wanna smoke up fine. I just don't really buy the arguments that everyone is in some big conspiracy to try and snuff it out. No,  
Speaker 0    00:04:17    There  
Speaker 1    00:04:18    The idea and the idea that the drug war will end and the idea that it's it's cures cancer. I just don't buy that. And people get so upset.  
Speaker 0    00:04:24    Well, well listen,  
Speaker 1    00:04:25    The point. That's why I, when  
Speaker 0    00:04:26    Studies have proven that it shrinks tumors, that it helps people with cancer, much like tumor Meric, much like any things that reduce inflammation and  
Speaker 1    00:04:34    Heart cherry.  
Speaker 0    00:04:35    Right. But it's not necessary. They're all legal. And there's no issue cuz they're not psychoactive. Right. But they are beneficial. So all these things are good. Marijuana is one of the things that are good. And don't sure, man, just like you, don't sure to Merick you don't shore ginger, you don't shore a reduced sugar diet. All those things that reduce inflammation are good for  
Speaker 1    00:04:56    You. I, I don't, I don't buy that. Smoking marijuana would be as beneficial as a reduced sugar diet. And my point is that people might be you so offended saying and saying, but if you wanna smoke, go  
Speaker 0    00:05:04    Ahead. You might be correct. Shouldn't be offended. It doesn't matter because it's not a fucking contest to see what's the most beneficial. It, the question is, is it beneficial? And is it damaging? It is.  
Speaker 1    00:05:12    It does matter. The fact, No, no. Let, lemme finish my point. It does matter. You said, what would you not talk about? I said probably pot. Cause I don't care. Well what do you think about  
Speaker 0    00:05:21    Care? That's what I think about  
Speaker 1    00:05:22    It, about it. And your eyes light up and all of a sudden ideolog in world care like crazy shouldn't be discussed. No you you're gonna laser in a, like a tractor beam on the most important issue of the day that I said, I don't care.  
Speaker 0    00:05:33    You're the guy that thinks people should be able to do whatever. You're a free market guy. I just said. So if you're a free market guy, why wouldn't you be support of something? Whether it's the most beneficial. I just, that I am or equally beneficial. I am, but you're not necessarily because you're you're denying because denying  
Speaker 1    00:05:51    Of a chemical calm,  
Speaker 0    00:05:52    Hold on face. You're denying.  
Speaker 1    00:05:54    Come on. It's been a  
Speaker 0    00:05:56    Conversation. We're friends. I'm just joking. Since marijuana legalization, highway fatalities in Colorado are at,  
Speaker 1    00:06:02    We, we haven't been bringing up the source that you want to find Washington. The study right there at yeah. Washington post bring up the study that we wrote. We wrote about on our website. Well,  
Speaker 0    00:06:09    Look, I don't care about your website. You fuck. Since marijuana legalization, highway fatalities in Colorado, since you called me a,  
Speaker 1    00:06:18    Since you called me, since you called me a fucking a pus and you do this with the crazy lady at comedy  
Speaker 0    00:06:22    Club on funny, I like  
Speaker 1    00:06:23    You. You think if you scream enough that it makes a point. My point is I don't care about it. I don't think that if we up and you just said I was interrupting, you're interrupting now screaming. I don't care about  
Speaker 0    00:06:30    Up a post. You're not  
Speaker 1    00:06:32    Don't buy, ignoring it. That it's as valuable as a low sugar diet. And the fact  
Speaker 0    00:06:35    Doesn't have to fact,  
Speaker 1    00:06:37    You can't have a conversation about this as civilly as you did. Every other issue tells me that there's a, that's not, there's a problem. This is a TT powder.  
Speaker 0    00:06:44    K I can the is I get very defensive. When people start talking over me and you start it first. But the, the reality is that a, a low sugar diet is fine. Sure. It's good too. But why is there a competition between a low your diet and tuber and marijuana and CBD oil? Why, why, why  
Speaker 1    00:07:02    Does, is making the claim regarding legality? That it cures cancer? My  
Speaker 0    00:07:08    Don't believe legal.  
Speaker 1    00:07:09    No. My only point is, cause  
Speaker 0    00:07:10    The other ones are already legal. They don't  
Speaker 1    00:07:12    Have to fight for. Yeah, but no one's prescribing. No one's dishing out, uh, dispensaries for toric or injur. They  
Speaker 0    00:07:16    Certainly are. If you go to these local G shops, anyway,  
Speaker 1    00:07:19    You  
Speaker 0    00:07:19    Go to these juice shops. People are  
Speaker 1    00:07:20    Promoting couldn't couldn't  
Speaker 0    00:07:22    Tome like crazy online. People  
Speaker 1    00:07:23    Couldn't care. Less people wanna smoke joints. You're  
Speaker 0    00:07:25    An log buddy.  
Speaker 1    00:07:27    Really? That's an idiot log position by saying leave it to the states. Yeah. You you're.  
Speaker 0    00:07:30    You are locked in man. Really?  
Speaker 1    00:07:33    And prove  
Speaker 0    00:07:34    You full of shit about Colorado and traffic deaths. Should we go and lock you up with this too?  
Speaker 1    00:07:40    Yeah. When you have your guy looking up, sources, you feel  
Speaker 0    00:07:42    Bad about the Colorado thing at all.  
Speaker 1    00:07:43    What, what? I never said Colorado. I said states that legalize,  
Speaker 0    00:07:46    What other ones  
Speaker 1    00:07:46    Are there? Well, you didn't bring up the source that I wrote about  
Speaker 2    00:07:48    I, well, I can,  
Speaker 1    00:07:49    But the fact that you're still hung up,  
Speaker 0    00:07:51    Please hold please. What?  
Speaker 2    00:07:52    I, I got the article. I've been looking at it for like the last few minutes on your website.  
Speaker 1    00:07:55    Yeah.  
Speaker 2    00:07:56    There's a couple statements that are really bad. Just off the, just off the gate like this right here. If you wanna get higher a moron. Hmm. Well  
Speaker 0    00:08:03    Getting high, make you more.  
Speaker 1    00:08:04    That's not, that's not a news article.  
Speaker 0    00:08:06    Hold  
Speaker 1    00:08:06    On, please. That's  
Speaker 0    00:08:07    Commentary. Hold on. But fine. After all things like Coachella wouldn't exist. Is this your article? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:08:13    I it's an article on my site. Wait  
Speaker 0    00:08:14    A minute. If you could wanna get high. You're what you're a moron. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:08:18    Think  
Speaker 0    00:08:18    You're a moron.  
Speaker 1    00:08:19    I think Courtney who's  
Speaker 0    00:08:21    Courtney she's works.  
Speaker 1    00:08:22    One of the best writers. I think I've ever encountered. How  
Speaker 0    00:08:24    Dare you not read then?  
Speaker 2    00:08:25    But so then the article links to a couple, uh, like this for instance is one that says it has deadliest year of traffic fatally since 2008. Yeah. This article doesn't say anything about marijuana. Not one, one thing doesn't mention me weed at once. It does say that it could be a Beed to prices, people driving more, more people in the state. Sure. Cetera, et cetera.  
Speaker 0    00:08:46    First  
Speaker 1    00:08:46    Off, that's not the only thing. This is important. I'm gonna defend myself here because you have someone here at the ready. And what you do is instead of bringing up information, this is what happens with Christopher ti, right? You don't have information that you bring up, you have another guy look up a source that you specifically want him to find.  
Speaker 0    00:09:00    I didn't ask him to bring that up.  
Speaker 1    00:09:02    Did he just brought it up? He brought up Washington post and he goes, this is what's wrong with your article taking a joke. You  
Speaker 0    00:09:05    You've already been talked. You didn't have a joke.  
Speaker 1    00:09:08    The joke in there about things that Coachella wouldn't exist. If there weren't that's  
Speaker 0    00:09:12    In that article, that's  
Speaker 1    00:09:13    A joke. Right? But to triangle, do you think people who smoke hot mores? No. It's a joke. Okay. Let's not do that. Okay. Let's not do that.  
Speaker 0    00:09:19    And no pots not comparable to alcohol. There are tests that determine how much alcohol content is in your bloodstream. We can't you do that with weed. So it's impossible to handle these incidents in the same way. That's but there have, okay. But there have been tests where they showed people,  
Speaker 1    00:09:32    But that would go back to what he said and what you  
Speaker 0    00:09:34    Said. But there have been has where they've shown people drunk versus on marijuana and the people on marijuana drove far better. Okay. That's true. So this  
Speaker 1    00:09:42    Is also anecdotal. No, these are tests. It goes back to your point, right? Let's say someone has alcohol in, are  
Speaker 0    00:09:47    These tests?  
Speaker 1    00:09:48    Well, I don't, I haven't read your tests.  
Speaker 0    00:09:49    Okay. So why you arguing  
Speaker 1    00:09:51    Against them? No, I'm saying I agreed with your point earlier.  
Speaker 0    00:09:53    So why are you saying they're anecdotal  
Speaker 1    00:09:55    Is anecdotal. If you're saying some people drive better on marijuana.  
Speaker 0    00:09:58    I'm not saying that I've said there have been tests where they've shown that people drive better on marijuana than alcohol. That's  
Speaker 1    00:10:03    Anecdotal. My point is, if you're, you're looking to be really  
Speaker 0    00:10:07    Good at this  
Speaker 1    00:10:07    Argument. No, I'm, I'm not, you just settle down. You said you wouldn't pile on and you got two people down. It is talking When someone, the show, when someone comes on the show, Jared can, cannot enter. Congratulations.  
Speaker 0    00:10:19    You're not show. And all he did was pull  
Speaker 1    00:10:22    Up fucking inform, bringing up information me without a laptop. No, he brought it up. He  
Speaker 0    00:10:27    Didn't about  
Speaker 1    00:10:28    It. You said what would be the one thing that you've changed your mind and that you problem  
Speaker 0    00:10:31    With two people are correct. And you're incorrect. Is that bother you?  
Speaker 1    00:10:34    I don't agree that you're correct. What  
Speaker 0    00:10:35    Are you talking about? You just pulled up to some statistics that show that Colorado has less traffic.  
Speaker 1    00:10:39    No, no, I didn't any statistics? No, he, you just said, said, you, you just said you I'll  
Speaker 0    00:10:45    Laptop. I'll turn my laptop. And you can, you can, What  
Speaker 1    00:10:50    Is the issue that you would care about? The lease that you've changed your mind? I said, probably wouldn't even talk about that.  
Speaker 0    00:10:54    That's that's a long version of what you said and you  
Speaker 1    00:10:57    Said,  
Speaker 0    00:10:57    Well, why was there been more fatalities since marijuana has been legal in those  
Speaker 1    00:11:02    States, in all the things we've  
Speaker 0    00:11:03    Discussed, that's not true. Why  
Speaker 1    00:11:04    Are you so obsessed with the pot  
Speaker 0    00:11:05    Issue? Because you're not right. And it doesn't matter if we've talked about it for four hours. So in this instance you are incorrect. You know, you're  
Speaker 1    00:11:11    No, I'm not incorrect. In that instance, the traffic fatal have increased in areas where pot of increased. We did the same study in Michigan, where pot was legalized and people were actually, uh, wait a minute, selling more marijuana, underage kids. I don't care if they  
Speaker 0    00:11:21    Doesn't have anything to do with traffic fatalities to do with it. It doesn't have anything to do with traffic fatalities, unless you can prove there's more traffic fatalities than underage kids. Since marijuana has been legal.  
Speaker 1    00:11:29    Yeah. There have been several articles that have made that claim made that assertion let's find written about it. Let's find them.  
Speaker 2    00:11:34    They all come from one article mostly. And it's from this, these AAA staff, and this is the stats that they said. And it's most, almost all the articles you're talking about. Come from this one article.  
Speaker 1    00:11:43    Okay?  
Speaker 0    00:11:43    Okay. So this is the percentage of drivers involved in fatal crashes who recently used marijuana more than doubled from eight to 17%, from 2014 or 2013, 2014, one in six drivers involved in fatal crashes from 2014 had recently used marijuana, which is the most recent data available. Now you understand that increases  
Speaker 1    00:12:06    Involv marijuana correlation is alarming.  
Speaker 0    00:12:09    Yeah. It says who, that's  
Speaker 2    00:12:10    An opinion.  
Speaker 0    00:12:11    It's an opinion,  
Speaker 1    00:12:11    President you triple a foundation. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:12:13    Says it's alarming. Well, is that, is that a matter of more people smoking marijuana because it's legal or it's a, is it a matter of the marijuana causing these accidents is  
Speaker 1    00:12:23    An article  
Speaker 0    00:12:23    Put out by, do you know what else is true? Do you know what else is true? That all these people also had alcohol in their system. Do you know that? Well,  
Speaker 1    00:12:29    No. I, we don't know that all of them alcohol,  
Speaker 0    00:12:30    Well, a giant percentage of people  
Speaker 1    00:12:33    Just made assumption said, you know, this be true.  
Speaker 0    00:12:35    I, this,  
Speaker 1    00:12:35    Because ive read these, them had alcohol in their system. You prove  
Speaker 0    00:12:38    A lot of  
Speaker 1    00:12:39    Them rewind. The tape made.  
Speaker 0    00:12:40    They did say all a lot of  
Speaker 1    00:12:41    Them. Well, you made a lot of assumptions.  
Speaker 0    00:12:43    Let's find out  
Speaker 2    00:12:43    It doesn't say anything in the article about alcohol though. And for sure they should have tested that and put  
Speaker 1    00:12:49    For sure they can't test for how many people smoke up a joint, just Google. What does that do with anything? It makes a point that you're gonna have an obvious position that would disagree with this one single article. So if I can finish a point, you've talked about interruption, let me finish the one point that I'm making. Well, you've proven for marijuana. You've already been proven test for marijuana roadside. Right? Can  
Speaker 0    00:13:07    We agree? No, you absolutely can. You can new tests. Okay. There's new tests. Let's find enough before you,  
Speaker 1    00:13:14    You do that, but they didn't test. Like you said, how  
Speaker 0    00:13:16    Many of the, how many of the marijuana related fatalities also involved alcohol? Cuz it's a massively significant percentage. Yeah. So you can't necessarily say that just because they have these new tests for marijuana, especially road size. Now  
Speaker 1    00:13:30    That's the problem is you can't okay. I'll tell you what, I'll give you that. What do you give? Let, let let's say you're correct, but here's the thing  
Speaker 0    00:13:38    Physiologically. It doesn't have an effect on motor skills the way alcohol does or it doesn't slow down your response time. Well, I  
Speaker 1    00:13:44    Know that we've we've, we've had several doctors in the show, two of whom had differing opinions on that.  
Speaker 0    00:13:48    They don't have to be right. They  
Speaker 1    00:13:51    Don't have  
Speaker 0    00:13:51    To be right opinions of it. Do they opinions one themselves? Do they know what it's like  
Speaker 1    00:13:56    Into this? This whole  
Speaker 0    00:13:57    Different C BS news caught blatantly distorting cannabis study says legal doubles, fatal car  
Speaker 1    00:14:03    Crash from mini press news min press news. So again, we can go into questioning sources all day long. If you have someone else bringing up sources, don't think this  
Speaker 0    00:14:10    Is a good source. You think  
Speaker 1    00:14:11    Maybe it, maybe it is. Let's say you're right  
Speaker 2    00:14:12    Crowder. But  
Speaker 1    00:14:13    Let's say you're well, lot of are sources up to something else I know. And sources look on one issue. And you said, hold on, what's the issue. You don't care.  
Speaker 2    00:14:20    I have your sources right here. I've looked them up. There's people online. Also sourcing them. They are skewed. You're skewing them to make. And  
Speaker 1    00:14:27    So the Washington post study that you skewed, but  
Speaker 0    00:14:29    You're not the Washington post. You're supposed to be the answer to the Washington post post. I'm not  
Speaker 1    00:14:32    The answer to the Washington post.  
Speaker 0    00:14:33    Don't say that someone's evil. So I'm evil to,  
Speaker 1    00:14:35    Well you just  
Speaker 0    00:14:35    Said that, that what you're saying,  
Speaker 1    00:14:36    That's the argument that you just made. No,  
Speaker 0    00:14:37    I didn't make that  
Speaker 1    00:14:38    Argument  
Speaker 0    00:14:39    Argument. You just said, come  
Speaker 1    00:14:40    On, man. You just made that argument. And all of a sudden, when someone mentions pot, you put on idiot or your worldview, the lens of  
Speaker 0    00:14:47    We, no.  
Speaker 1    00:14:48    And you upset, upset,  
Speaker 0    00:14:49    You get opinion. Bullshit has nothing to do with weed,  
Speaker 1    00:14:51    But you haven't made an argument. I haven't made an argument. You  
Speaker 0    00:14:53    Said  
Speaker 1    00:14:55    We  
Speaker 0    00:14:56    Showed  
Speaker 1    00:14:56    You would have to Colorado. What have you shown me?  
Speaker 0    00:14:59    We showed you this to.
