	Speaker 0: So (93.00%) I'm (98.00%) so (45.00%) it's (70.00%) a (98.00%) little (100.00%) intimidating (100.00%), but (100.00%) what (100.00%) he (100.00%) would (100.00%) do (100.00%) is (99.00%) he (100.00%) would (100.00%) do (100.00%) things (100.00%) indirect (100.00%) and (98.00%) it (100.00%) wasn't (100.00%) about (100.00%) calming (100.00%) the (100.00%) waters (100.00%). It (100.00%) was (100.00%) about (100.00%) stirring (100.00%) up (100.00%) the (100.00%) waters (100.00%) and (99.00%) creating (100.00%) a (100.00%) storm (100.00%) that (100.00%) eventually (100.00%) would (97.00%) lead (98.00%) this (100.00%) broken (100.00%) ship (95.00%) to (100.00%) the (99.00%) shore (100.00%). It (99.00%) was (100.00%) trying (100.00%) to (99.00%) get (100.00%) to (99.00%) in (99.00%) the (98.00%) first (100.00%) place (100.00%) <laugh> (66.00%) so (30.00%) what (56.00%) he (99.00%) constantly (99.00%) instigating (100.00%) and (98.00%) steering (70.00%) waits (59.00%). That's (99.00%) what (100.00%) he (99.00%) was (99.00%) doing (99.00%), man (59.00%). So (99.00%) like (97.00%), if (100.00%) you (100.00%) ever (99.00%) seen (95.00%) the (92.00%) movie (100.00%) Moana (96.00%), if (100.00%) anybody (98.00%) has (99.00%) kids (100.00%) here (100.00%), I'm (100.00%) sure (100.00%) you've (100.00%) seen (96.00%) Moana (97.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Right (98.00%)? When (100.00%) she (100.00%) goes (100.00%) out (100.00%) and (100.00%) all (100.00%) of (80.00%) a (89.00%) sudden (100.00%) there's (100.00%) a (99.00%) storm (100.00%) and (100.00%) she (100.00%) loses (100.00%) her (99.00%) mind (100.00%), thinks (99.00%) everything (100.00%) is (99.00%) lost (100.00%). And (100.00%) all (100.00%) of (68.00%) a (88.00%) sudden (100.00%) she (100.00%) wakes (100.00%) up (100.00%) and (100.00%) she's (100.00%) right (99.00%) where (100.00%) she (100.00%) was (99.00%) supposed (99.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%). That's (100.00%) it (28.00%)? Wow (80.00%). That's (100.00%) a (99.00%) great (100.00%) example (100.00%). Great (99.00%) example (100.00%). So (99.00%) you (48.00%) we're (97.00%) coming (100.00%) out (84.00%) to (76.00%) the (99.00%) last (100.00%) 15 (66.00%) minutes (100.00%). I (100.00%) got (82.00%) a (98.00%) list (100.00%) of (99.00%) questions (100.00%) that (99.00%) I'm (100.00%) not (99.00%) gonna (96.00%) get (99.00%) to (99.00%), but (99.00%) I (93.00%) do (96.00%) wanna (57.00%) ask (99.00%) a (60.00%) couple (100.00%) of (77.00%) these (99.00%) is (98.00%) your (66.00%) plan (55.00%) against (100.00%) the (96.00%) golden (100.00%) state (100.00%) warriors (100.00%) score (100.00%) is (99.00%) 1 0 7 1 0 9 (93.00%). You (100.00%) guys (100.00%) are (100.00%) close (93.00%) to (100.00%) getting (100.00%) into (99.00%) the (100.00%) playoff (95.00%). You (99.00%) know (99.00%) exactly (100.00%) what (100.00%) happens (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) game (100.00%). You (100.00%) go (100.00%) up (100.00%), you're (100.00%) about (100.00%) to (100.00%) take (100.00%) your (100.00%) shot (100.00%). And (100.00%) then (93.00%) all (100.00%) of (100.00%) a (94.00%) sudden (100.00%), boom (89.00%). Yeah (73.00%). Achilles (99.00%) happens (99.00%), right (99.00%)?

And (100.00%) he (100.00%) told (100.00%) me (99.00%), he (52.00%) says (97.00%), Patrick (99.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (100.00%) you (100.00%) understand (100.00%). He (100.00%) says (98.00%), when (100.00%) I (100.00%) tore (55.00%) my (99.00%) Achilles (99.00%) in (100.00%) high (100.00%) school (99.00%), he (93.00%) says (97.00%), four (99.00%) friends (98.00%) of (100.00%) mine (99.00%) dragged (95.00%) me (99.00%) to (87.00%) my (87.00%) house (54.00%). I (95.00%) was (98.00%) crying (99.00%) from (99.00%) their (69.00%) straight (94.00%) to (97.00%) the (97.00%) hospital (87.00%). He (91.00%) says (95.00%), I (99.00%) have (100.00%) no (100.00%) clue (100.00%) how (100.00%) the (100.00%) hell (100.00%) this (100.00%) guy (100.00%) did (100.00%) it (100.00%). He (100.00%) went (100.00%) and (99.00%) hit (99.00%) the (100.00%) free (99.00%) throws (98.00%).

And (99.00%) then (95.00%) you (96.00%) got (99.00%) the (99.00%) surgery (100.00%) done (43.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Yeah (88.00%). How (100.00%) the (100.00%) hell (100.00%) do (99.00%) you (99.00%) tolerate (100.00%) that (100.00%) kind (91.00%) of (93.00%) pain (100.00%)? Uh (95.00%), you (99.00%) know (99.00%), I (90.00%), I (95.00%) use (76.00%) this (83.00%), I (94.00%) tell (100.00%) this (100.00%) example (100.00%) and (96.00%) I (100.00%) think (99.00%) this (100.00%) is (99.00%) the (100.00%) best (100.00%) way (100.00%) to (100.00%) explain (100.00%) it (100.00%). Um (96.00%), you (95.00%) know (95.00%), you (100.00%) have (100.00%) a (49.00%) hamstring (99.00%) injury (100.00%), you (100.00%) pull (100.00%) your (98.00%) hamstring (99.00%) really (100.00%), really (100.00%) badly (100.00%). You (99.00%) can (100.00%) barely (100.00%) walk (100.00%), right (99.00%)? Let (100.00%) alone (100.00%) play (100.00%) anything (100.00%), soccer (100.00%), basketball (100.00%), volleyball (100.00%), whatever (100.00%) it (98.00%) is (84.00%). Can't (100.00%) do (100.00%) anything (100.00%). Doctor (92.00%) tells (100.00%) you (99.00%), go (93.00%) home (100.00%), sit (100.00%) up (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (77.00%) couch (100.00%), rest (77.00%) your (100.00%) hammy (71.00%). Right (98.00%)? Stay (100.00%) off (100.00%) of (99.00%) it (100.00%). Don't (100.00%) get (100.00%) up (100.00%). No (99.00%) sudden (85.00%) movements (100.00%). You're (99.00%) at (100.00%) home (100.00%). All (100.00%) of (96.00%) a (90.00%) sudden (100.00%), a (56.00%), a (96.00%) fire (100.00%) breaks (99.00%) out (100.00%) in (99.00%) the (86.00%) home (99.00%), right (96.00%)? Your (98.00%) kids (99.00%) are (99.00%) upstairs (100.00%). You (96.00%) know (96.00%), wife (99.00%) is (99.00%), you (57.00%) know (67.00%), wherever (99.00%) she (100.00%) may (99.00%) be (100.00%). You (93.00%) know (94.00%) this (95.00%) shit's (100.00%) going (99.00%) down (100.00%), right (83.00%). I'm (100.00%) willing (100.00%) to (100.00%) bet (100.00%) that (99.00%) you're (100.00%) gonna (94.00%) forget (100.00%) about (100.00%) your (99.00%) hamstring (99.00%). You're (100.00%) gonna (80.00%) sprint (98.00%) upstairs (100.00%). You're (99.00%) gonna (94.00%) grab (100.00%) your (100.00%) kids (100.00%). You're (95.00%) gonna (75.00%) make (100.00%) sure (100.00%) your (99.00%) wife's (100.00%) good (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: You're (93.00%) getting (98.00%) outta (55.00%) that (99.00%) house (100.00%). Right (99.00%). Hamstring (99.00%). Be (95.00%) them (53.00%). You're (99.00%) not (100.00%) gonna (90.00%) fill (71.00%) your (98.00%) hamstring (99.00%). Right (98.00%). And (95.00%) the (99.00%) reason (100.00%) is (99.00%) because (98.00%) the (100.00%) lives (100.00%) of (100.00%) your (100.00%) family (100.00%) are (99.00%) more (100.00%) important (100.00%) than (97.00%) the (94.00%) injury (100.00%) of (100.00%) your (99.00%) hamstring (96.00%). And (98.00%) so (100.00%) when (100.00%) the (99.00%) game (100.00%) is (100.00%) more (100.00%) important (100.00%) than (96.00%) the (100.00%) injury (100.00%) itself (100.00%), you (100.00%) don't (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (100.00%) damn (97.00%) injury (99.00%). Not (99.00%) at (99.00%) that (99.00%) time (99.00%). Yeah (62.00%). So (99.00%) you (100.00%) go (99.00%) to (93.00%) the (99.00%) locker (100.00%) room (100.00%), you (99.00%) guys (100.00%) had (98.00%) a (99.00%) shot (100.00%) that (95.00%), you (94.00%) know (94.00%), to (98.00%) go (99.00%) into (88.00%) the (89.00%), you (97.00%) guys (100.00%) were (99.00%) a (98.00%) team (99.00%) that (99.00%) no (100.00%) one (97.00%) wanted (99.00%) to (99.00%) face (100.00%). Even (99.00%) though (95.00%) there (96.00%) was (100.00%) conflict (100.00%), you (96.00%) know (96.00%), maybe (99.00%) if (100.00%) you (97.00%) would've (99.00%) gone (98.00%) round (63.00%) one (99.00%), who (100.00%) knows (100.00%), maybe (99.00%) Dwight (96.00%) would've (100.00%) gone (94.00%) together (100.00%). You (98.00%) know (98.00%), who (100.00%) knows (100.00%) what (100.00%) was (98.00%) gonna (96.00%) happen (99.00%)? It's (78.00%) just (86.00%), you (99.00%) were (36.00%) the (87.00%) kind (94.00%) of (96.00%) team (99.00%) that (99.00%) look (96.00%), it's (99.00%) just (99.00%) a (68.00%) then (52.00%) about (99.00%) to (93.00%) face (98.00%) these (99.00%) guys (96.00%). We (76.00%) just (75.00%) hoping (100.00%) you (100.00%) don't (100.00%) make (100.00%) the (99.00%) playoffs (97.00%). Right (99.00%). I'm (100.00%) sure (100.00%) a (99.00%) lot (98.00%) of (99.00%) people (100.00%) were (97.00%) very (100.00%) happy (100.00%) that (94.00%) you (98.00%) guys (99.00%) didn't (97.00%) make (100.00%) the (99.00%) playoffs (95.00%) that (59.00%) year (50.00%), but (100.00%) you (100.00%) go (84.00%) into (82.00%) the (97.00%) locker (100.00%) room (100.00%) and (100.00%) then (80.00%) one (88.00%) of (60.00%) the (98.00%) reporters (99.00%) comes (100.00%) up (100.00%) to (100.00%) you (100.00%) and (100.00%) he (98.00%) says (100.00%) to (100.00%) you (99.00%), Kobe (87.00%), are (100.00%) you (100.00%) convinced (100.00%) that (99.00%) they (100.00%) told (100.00%) you (100.00%) it's (100.00%) probably (100.00%) torn (99.00%) Achilles (92.00%). 

	Speaker 0: They're (100.00%) gonna (99.00%) do (100.00%) an (99.00%) MRI (92.00%). Are (100.00%) you (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) convinced (100.00%)? That's (100.00%) what (100.00%) it (100.00%) is (98.00%). And (97.00%) your (94.00%) as (50.00%) answer (99.00%) is (99.00%), yeah (98.00%). Then (99.00%) one (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (97.00%) reporters (97.00%) says (99.00%), but (99.00%) if (100.00%) anyone (100.00%) is (99.00%) gonna (93.00%) get (100.00%) through (100.00%) this (99.00%), it's (99.00%) probably (100.00%) you (100.00%). Right (100.00%). You (100.00%) put (100.00%) your (100.00%) head (100.00%) down (100.00%) and (100.00%) you (100.00%) say (100.00%), oh (76.00%) man (99.00%), shit (100.00%). Right (96.00%). And (59.00%) you (53.00%) have (57.00%) tears (100.00%) in (32.00%) your (96.00%) eyes (98.00%). Yeah (95.00%). Did (100.00%) you (100.00%) say (98.00%), oh (50.00%) man (94.00%), shit (99.00%). Because (100.00%) everybody's (99.00%) expecting (99.00%) me (98.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) invincible (100.00%), man (99.00%). Like (99.00%) freaking (70.00%) let (100.00%) me (99.00%) just (99.00%) play (96.00%) damn (55.00%) game (86.00%). I'm (100.00%) a (99.00%) human (100.00%) being (99.00%). Is (100.00%) that (100.00%) kind (93.00%) of (93.00%) what (94.00%) you (100.00%) were (100.00%) thinking (100.00%)? Or (99.00%) was (81.00%) it (92.00%) like (99.00%) the (99.00%) worlds (100.00%) expect (99.00%) me (100.00%) to (100.00%) come (100.00%) back (100.00%) in (98.00%) the (100.00%) next (100.00%) month (100.00%)? Cuz (72.00%) I'm (100.00%) Kobe (89.00%). Like (96.00%) what (100.00%) were (99.00%) you (99.00%) thinking (100.00%)? And (32.00%) that (90.00%) might (18.00%) all (89.00%) that (96.00%) pressure (100.00%). Oh (51.00%), I (100.00%) was (100.00%) thinking (100.00%) like (97.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) know (99.00%) if (100.00%) I (100.00%) can (100.00%) do (100.00%) this (100.00%). Achilles (99.00%) were (55.00%) like (97.00%) the (98.00%) kiss (99.00%) of (100.00%) death (95.00%). Yes (86.00%). Athletes (99.00%). Like (84.00%), I (95.00%) don't (92.00%), I (94.00%) don't (98.00%) know (98.00%) if (98.00%) I (99.00%) can (99.00%) do (100.00%) this (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) don't (98.00%) know (98.00%). There's (96.00%) so (100.00%) many (100.00%) factors (100.00%). There's (96.00%) the (55.00%) surgery (100.00%) that (100.00%) has (100.00%) to (100.00%) take (100.00%) place (100.00%). The (99.00%) surgery (100.00%) has (100.00%) to (100.00%) go (100.00%) well (100.00%). Right (99.00%). And (100.00%) then (99.00%) just (85.00%), it's (95.00%) a (60.00%) tendon (90.00%). I'm (100.00%) not (100.00%) dealing (100.00%) with (100.00%) anything (100.00%). That's (100.00%) muscular (100.00%) things (99.00%) that (99.00%) I (100.00%) can (100.00%) control (100.00%). I (100.00%) can't (100.00%) control (100.00%) a (31.00%) tendon (92.00%). You (99.00%) know (99.00%) what (79.00%) I'm (99.00%) saying (98.00%)? So (99.00%) like (97.00%), I (100.00%) don't (99.00%) know (99.00%). And (99.00%) then (99.00%) thinking (100.00%) about (100.00%) what (100.00%) that (99.00%) process (100.00%) of (80.00%) recovery's (99.00%) gonna (56.00%) look (89.00%) like (70.00%), it's (100.00%) a (96.00%) long (100.00%) one (99.00%). Do (100.00%) I (100.00%) want (88.00%) to (62.00%) do (99.00%) that (100.00%) shit (99.00%)? I (93.00%) don't (87.00%).
