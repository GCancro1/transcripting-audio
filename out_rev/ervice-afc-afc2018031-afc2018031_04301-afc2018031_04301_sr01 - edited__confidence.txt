	Speaker 1: Unhappy (98.00%) accident (100.00%)? We (100.00%) moved (100.00%) here (100.00%) from (100.00%) my (99.00%) in-law's (99.00%) basement (100.00%) about (100.00%) 80 (100.00%) miles (100.00%) north (100.00%) of (98.00%) here (98.00%), and (100.00%) I (100.00%) needed (100.00%) a (100.00%) job (100.00%) and (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) much (99.00%) all (100.00%) I'd (99.00%) had (99.00%) up (98.00%) to (98.00%) that (99.00%) point (99.00%) was (99.00%) farm (100.00%) work (98.00%), which (100.00%) is (99.00%) not (100.00%) a (99.00%) resume (100.00%) fluffer (97.00%). So (100.00%) I (100.00%) noticed (100.00%) that (96.00%) there (99.00%) was (100.00%) like (97.00%) a (97.00%), a (92.00%) weekend (100.00%) attendant (98.00%), I (100.00%) think (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (100.00%) facility (100.00%), not (100.00%) the (99.00%) one (99.00%) I'm (100.00%) currently (100.00%) working (96.00%) at (98.00%), but (98.00%) at (55.00%), uh (61.00%), at (83.00%) one (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) basic (100.00%) trash (100.00%) and (99.00%) recycling (100.00%) collection (100.00%) centers (99.00%), they (48.00%) used (99.00%) to (99.00%) have (100.00%) about (99.00%) 10 (100.00%) years (100.00%) ago (100.00%). Uh (80.00%), they (100.00%) needed (100.00%) someone (94.00%) to (41.00%) fill (98.00%) a (99.00%) couple (100.00%) hours (100.00%) a (100.00%) week (100.00%). And (100.00%) the (100.00%) first (100.00%) day (100.00%) I (99.00%) showed (100.00%) up (100.00%) there (99.00%) was (95.00%) an (99.00%) ambulance (100.00%). And (100.00%) one (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) people (100.00%) who (99.00%) had (82.00%) been (100.00%) working (100.00%) there (100.00%) was (98.00%) an (99.00%) older (100.00%) woman (50.00%) who (100.00%) had (100.00%) been (100.00%) ignoring (100.00%) a (100.00%) football (100.00%) sized (67.00%) ovarian (100.00%) cist (73.00%) for (100.00%) several (100.00%) months (100.00%). Uh (90.00%), it (91.00%) had (96.00%) finally (100.00%) incapacitated (100.00%) her (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) job (100.00%). And (100.00%) I (100.00%) showed (100.00%) up (100.00%) for (94.00%) what (100.00%) I (99.00%) thought (99.00%) was (93.00%) it (87.00%) was (96.00%) an (96.00%) interview (100.00%) and (92.00%) a (99.00%) quick (100.00%) training (100.00%). And (100.00%) she (100.00%) said (100.00%), well (99.00%), I (100.00%) guess (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) a (100.00%) slot (99.00%) for (100.00%) you (100.00%) now (97.00%). Um (84.00%), it's (92.00%) just (97.00%) a (70.00%), a (97.00%) real (99.00%) shocker (100.00%). I (97.00%) think (99.00%) people (99.00%) knew (100.00%) she (100.00%) was (99.00%) having (100.00%) some (98.00%) medical (99.00%) issues (100.00%), but (100.00%) they (99.00%) didn't (99.00%) realize (96.00%) it (61.00%) was (96.00%) anything (99.00%) that (99.00%) substantial (100.00%). Um (77.00%), and (99.00%) I (99.00%) fell (99.00%) into (70.00%) that (100.00%) position (100.00%). And (99.00%) so (100.00%) that's (100.00%) where (73.00%) I (99.00%) started (99.00%) doing (100.00%) it (97.00%) about (99.00%) four (100.00%) days (100.00%) a (100.00%) week (100.00%), give (100.00%) or (100.00%) take (100.00%) at (99.00%) different (100.00%) facilities (100.00%) throughout (100.00%) the (100.00%) district (100.00%). 

	Speaker 2: Mm-hmm (79.00%) <affirmative> (60.00%). 

	Speaker 0: And (99.00%), um (94.00%), how (98.00%) did (88.00%), how (94.00%) did (99.00%) you (100.00%) learn (100.00%) what (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: It's (100.00%) very (100.00%) much (100.00%) O (95.00%) J (72.00%) T (99.00%) uh (91.00%), on (100.00%) the (84.00%) job (84.00%) training (100.00%), right (100.00%)? So (100.00%) you (100.00%) can (100.00%) have (100.00%) a (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) good (100.00%) idea (100.00%) of (100.00%) what (100.00%) is (100.00%) garbage (100.00%) and (99.00%) what (100.00%) is (100.00%) recyclable (100.00%) or (99.00%) what (100.00%) is (99.00%) hazardous (96.00%) waste (100.00%). And (99.00%) even (100.00%) if (100.00%) you (100.00%) don't (100.00%), you (100.00%) can (99.00%) kind (89.00%) of (82.00%) start (100.00%) from (100.00%) zero (100.00%) and (77.00%), and (53.00%) get (100.00%) to (100.00%) where (100.00%) you (100.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%). I (100.00%) was (90.00%) kind (100.00%) of (99.00%) a (93.00%) recycling (99.00%) nerd (98.00%) up (45.00%) to (99.00%) that (100.00%) point (100.00%). Anyway (99.00%), I (100.00%) was (100.00%) just (99.00%) very (100.00%) focused (100.00%) on (100.00%) it (100.00%), but (100.00%) we (95.00%), at (100.00%) that (100.00%) time (100.00%), before (100.00%) moving (99.00%) to (62.00%), to (87.00%) Plainfield (86.00%), before (100.00%) we (63.00%) moved (100.00%) to (99.00%) Barry (51.00%), I (95.00%) started (99.00%) working (100.00%) in (83.00%) Barry (59.00%), had (100.00%) been (100.00%) living (100.00%) in (97.00%) a (98.00%) place (100.00%) where (99.00%) there's (100.00%) not (100.00%) a (99.00%) lot (98.00%) of (98.00%) recycling (100.00%) going (100.00%) on (100.00%) up (100.00%) in (100.00%) Franklin (100.00%) county (100.00%). And (100.00%) yeah (100.00%), like (94.00%) her (86.00%) parents (99.00%) just (96.00%) threw (99.00%) it (99.00%) all (98.00%) in (93.00%) one (99.00%) big (100.00%) trash (100.00%) can (89.00%). So (100.00%) I (100.00%) knew (100.00%) what (100.00%) was (100.00%) supposed (99.00%) to (52.00%) be (99.00%) recycled (100.00%), but (99.00%) I (92.00%) knew (100.00%) there (99.00%) was (97.00%) all (76.00%) also (38.00%) no (68.00%) enforcement (100.00%) and (100.00%) not (100.00%) a (99.00%) lot (100.00%) of (100.00%) supplies (100.00%) offered (100.00%) from (100.00%) her (100.00%) current (100.00%) trash (100.00%) haul (82.00%). Uh (91.00%), so (100.00%) I (97.00%) didn't (100.00%) keep (100.00%) up (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) education (100.00%) in (100.00%) that (100.00%) regard (100.00%), but (100.00%) I (100.00%) knew (100.00%) that (100.00%) there (99.00%) were (100.00%) things (100.00%) you (100.00%) could (98.00%) do (100.00%), like (99.00%) soda (92.00%) bottles (100.00%) and (100.00%) newspapers (100.00%) and (99.00%) aluminum (99.00%) cans (98.00%) and (97.00%) all (93.00%) like (59.00%) the (88.00%) classic (100.00%) side (99.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) road (87.00%) recycling (100.00%). I (62.00%).
