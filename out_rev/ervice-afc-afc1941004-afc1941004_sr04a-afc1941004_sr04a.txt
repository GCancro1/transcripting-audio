Speaker 1    00:00:02    This is Wednesday, December 10th, 1941 last Sunday, three days ago on December 7th, the United States of America was attacked by armed forces of the Japanese empire, Indiana university and cooperation with the library of Congress of the United States has arranged to record some of the opinion of five representative students concerning the war. At this point, these students, we believe, uh, have opinions which should be taken into consideration because they are the people who will be bearing the brunt of this war. Uh, after the war actually gets underway. Uh, first I have up on my right Mr. Mike Fox, uh, a soft more Mr. Fox, uh, tell us just, uh, nearly as you can, just what you thought of the war when you heard of the declaration of war by Japan. I, I mean the attack of the Japanese planes upon Pearl Harbor last Sunday,  
Speaker 0    00:00:54    I was stunned at first. I didn't believe it  
Speaker 1    00:00:56    Did not believe it first. Well, after that, uh, period, uh, left you, then, what did you think about, well,  
Speaker 0    00:01:02    I'd say it was one of feeling of fury and anger that we had been betrayed  
Speaker 1    00:01:07    That you had been betrayed by the peaceman wound negotiators in Washington at the time that the, uh, actual attack did take place.  
Speaker 0    00:01:13    Yes,  
Speaker 2    00:01:14    I think, uh, I think, uh, our, uh, secretary of state must have been asleep if we were betrayed. Certainly, uh, if we need somebody in the Naval intelligence core to kind of find out what's going on, if we didn't know what was going on prior to the attack,  
Speaker 1    00:01:32    I see Mr. Uh, Roy believes that Boyer, Mr. Boyer believes that we were asleep miss Fargo.  
Speaker 3    00:01:37    And yet don't you feel that at the same time that perhaps it wasn't a matter of there being sleep, but rather of holding out to the very end and maintaining an American policy, which we have attempted to follow.  
Speaker 0    00:01:50    I agree with miss Fargo very much. We weren't asleep after all the Japanese asked for two extra weeks in negotiations, believing this to be in the guise of friendship we did. So they even sent another ambassador, Mr. Caruso, to interview the presence, the secretary of state, and after all under disguise, I don't think we could say anything but treachery.  
Speaker 4    00:02:08    We could trust the Japanese or any other the excess power since 1939,  
Speaker 0    00:02:13    Isn't it better to trust. And to she, the blood of so many millions of  
Speaker 4    00:02:16    People. Do you think that we have not been at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy since 1939, we  
Speaker 0    00:02:22    Have had a non belligerent status  
Speaker 4    00:02:24    UNR. In what  
Speaker 0    00:02:25    Sense we have not actually engaged in armed conflict with either of these people  
Speaker 4    00:02:28    And you're defining war merely as armed conflict. Yes, I am. And you're willing to cry treachery and betrayal that the other country gets a jump on us.  
Speaker 3    00:02:39    Oh, Paul, before we get off track here, I wonder, um, getting back to your first question, if any of the rest of you felt that Germany as a first reaction was behind this as a very well brought out well timed plan rather than Japan itself taking the lead on this. Ms.  
Speaker 1    00:02:57    Flo, what was your opinion about that?  
Speaker 3    00:02:59    Well, of course  
Speaker 5    00:03:00    It was a shock. We just got in from a hike Sunday afternoon along came these headlines, that war had been declared on the United States by Japan. I got sort of confused and told a Jewish dialect story to a bunch of Jewish students. And  
Speaker 3    00:03:17    Then we  
Speaker 5    00:03:19    Thought things over a while, but it, it just didn't seem right that Japan should be the one to make the attack. I would've expected an attack on the Atlantic first.  
Speaker 1    00:03:29    Well now, um, since we have some of the attitudes, which, uh, some of you had at the time of the, uh, when you heard of the, uh, attack by Japan, uh, I'd like to get just what some of your attitudes were concerning our foreign policy before this bombing. In other words, whether or not your attitudes were drastically changed by this bombing, Mr. Fox.  
Speaker 0    00:03:49    Well, I was definitely a cooperation before this. I don't believe an isolation never have  
Speaker 1    00:03:53    Cooperation. Is there, would you tell us what a cooperation?  
Speaker 0    00:03:56    Well, I, I believe that we should work in concert with the other democratic nation of the world. Long. I have felt that the difficulty of the United States has been that we, after framing the idea of the league nations dropped out of it. Uh, since the war broke out in 1939, I have felt that we should give England and later Russia, every assistance short of war. Now, my feelings are exactly the same in, in it.  
Speaker 2    00:04:20    Think Mr. Fox has been reading too many newspapers  
Speaker 0    00:04:23    Cause  
Speaker 2    00:04:25    That, uh, that is a traditional attitude, the democratic nations of the world, which, which there aren't any democratic nations outside of the United States and the, uh, we have cooperated economically, but we are putting, we are keeping the other countries of the world on, uh, I can't express what I mean to say, let someone else take over  
Speaker 3    00:04:55    Paul from a, from a student standpoint. I wonder if we don't lean a little bit towards, this is the, actually when we heard the president speech the other day and heard this unanimous, uh, enthusiastic reaction from our Congressman, we've been brought up for the past 19 and 20 years to have H war and to treat it as something of that is not a part of our culture. And then in the past few years, I don't believe we are too surprise at the Japanese action because we've seen what they've done in the past, and we've watched them fairly closely, but weren't, we a, a little bit used to the idea that we wanted to avoid everything at all costs. And then this sudden foreign war policy, uh, thrown upon us was rather a shock to this generation, as I, for one was rather surprised at the Congressman the other day cheering. So enthusiastically and yep. I think if I were there, I probably would've done the same thing.  
Speaker 1    00:05:51    Yes. The idea, I think, has been instilled into the minds of the youth of this country ever since the world war, that that war is the greatest of all evils and Mr. Fox, getting back to what you said just a moment ago, uh, you said that you believed, uh, in helping great Britain and the other democracies win this war, uh, by every means, short of war. In other words, you do not feel that the United States is war with Germany at the present time, to the same extent to which she is with Japan,  
Speaker 0    00:06:18    I would say morally. Yes, but looking at the problem realistically and practically, I believe that as a military standpoint, it is far better to fight on one front than on two, by concentrating our efforts on Japan. I have the opinion that we can knock her out of the war much more rapidly than we can. If our efforts are split by an AE F for example, Africa and an Atlantic fleet, which must see action in the Atlantic,  
Speaker 4    00:06:41    Don't forget. That's just exactly what Hitler wants us to do. If we concentrate entirely upon Japan, then we must stop our flow of goods to great Britain and Russia. And evidently the grand strategy back of the axis powers is to, uh, divert our flow of material.  
Speaker 5    00:06:58    But according to what the president said in his speech last night, he is intending to continue our shipments to Russia. And to England,  
Speaker 0    00:07:05    I'd like to call him as FO's attention. The fact that the only road left to Russia is now the road through Persia. Since a lot of us stock lies behind the Japanese archipelago. Therefore I believe that we can help Russia by sending all these supplies to Persia. But if we do get into the war with Germany, it means splitting our resources and justice. Germany did not want to fight on more than one front, neither should we,  
Speaker 3    00:07:27    In regard to that, we don't even know Russia stand yet.  
Speaker 2    00:07:31    Yes. In Germany, uh, Germany is the base for the whole thing. I think that we should get at the base of this thing instead of going around the fringes and taking the longest way and just go to the base and, uh, wipe that out. And then the whole thing will be  
Speaker 1    00:07:46    Solved. Then you would favor an immediate declaration of war. Yes. Germany  
Speaker 3    00:07:50    That's right. Well, it hasn't been our policy in the past to do that.  
Speaker 2    00:07:53    Well, I, I think we've, uh, gone too much on tradition now and that's, uh, Reese and this Pearl Harbor incident has come out. We have thought of this non-combatant tradition of the United States. I think we should quit fooling around with ideologies and get down to actual fighting and what is really happening here in the world.  
Speaker 5    00:08:14    Don't but the more time we have before we go to war was Germany, the more war planes we have, the more equipment we have, the better preparation we have. If we can put it off two weeks, then we have just two weeks advantage on supply.  
Speaker 0    00:08:27    I'd like to make just one more point. And that is that we have no common battlefield to meet Germany on against Japan. It is true that we can meet them at sea since they have a Navy. And we have also Germany on the other hand has virtually no Navy would have to send an a F to Africa, which there is a present or rather strong force of British, which are at the moment, at least successful.  
Speaker 1    00:08:47    Mr. Fox, do you feel that we must see the eventual feat of Germany before we can, uh, see any kind of a piece absolutely achieve the world? Well then what course do you recommend that we follow in order to achieve that, uh, defeat?  
Speaker 0    00:09:00    Well, I say to remain, to retain our presence status toward Germany accordingly, it is a status of actual non belligerency. In other words, we are at war morally, emotionally and physically, but we're not actually fighting. And yet I say, continue to fight the Japanese in an actual armed way. Eventually I feel that Japan will be the first to drop out from a matter of interior of internal weakness. Then we can turn our attention completely to the Germans after having eliminated one front completely.  
Speaker 1    00:09:24    And do you feel that an, an expeditionary force sent to the continent of Europe to fight Germany will be necessary  
Speaker 0    00:09:30    Eventually?  
Speaker 1    00:09:30    Yes, eventually, but at the present we must dispose of Japan.  
Speaker 0    00:09:34    I believe as  
Speaker 1    00:09:35    Your,  
Speaker 2    00:09:35    He mentioned, we didn't have any common battlefield we're on Iceland. We havet occupied. We could fly from Iceland to the continent and back, and we would have a common battlefield there. How about an a F up to  
Speaker 0    00:09:49    The, uh, Scandinavian countries you'll have to land at Norway, which is the president control of the Russia of the, uh, German. Sweden is not, is a neutral. And I feel certain were any attempt made to land on Sweden. They would call the assistance of Germany.  
Speaker 1    00:10:01    What  
Speaker 3    00:10:01    About south America's position in this too? I think that's a pretty important point that we haven't brought in as far as the, uh, concentration of, uh, German feeling in those countries.  
Speaker 1    00:10:12    Well, the, uh, Sanal the small south American countries have put at war and others have said that they will not recognize a state of belligerency between the United States and Japan, which is in the favor of the United States, because it means that we can use their Porsche just as we could in time of peace. I think they're all definitely sympathetic. Of course, they have been, uh, somewhat on the position that Japan has been in, namely that they want to be on the winning side <affirmative>, but, uh, they are so close to the United States that I think that they all realize that their destinies are pretty inevitably wrapped up with those of the United States. Uh, I don't think that any of us are alarmed over the, uh, what the south American countries might do in this regard to this war. Are we,  
Speaker 0    00:10:53    I don't believe,  
Speaker 2    00:10:53    Well, there isn't much that can do they're, uh, forced to do whatever they are doing. If they did want to do different, I think cause of their intimate relationship with the United States, it would be cut off completely economically and physically, and then every other way.  
Speaker 1    00:11:11    Well, I think we're all pretty generally agreed then that the United States must see that the eventually defeat of the act is powers in order to achieve a peace  
Speaker 0    00:11:20    I believe for right.  
Speaker 1    00:11:20    Mm-hmm <affirmative> I think that's more or less, uh, universally consented to, with this, uh, discussion. Well, now after this war is over, we're going to have a problem, which is even more important and that is this just what part the United States, uh, can and will play in the formation of some kind of a post-war world. Mr. Fox. Well,  
Speaker 0    00:11:41    Thereby hangs, I believe the entire problem. I think personally that if the United States will take part in the peace treaty and we will, we shouldn't make the mistakes that we made back at for SI in 1917, 18, and which caused us to remain at war officially with Germany, till the twenties. If we are going to set up an international, uh, association of nations, then we must be in it, right? We must give that association some form of teeth so that it will work. Certainly if Germany is beaten, we cannot kick her when it's down, because this same situation will occur. At the end of 20 years, it has occurred. Now a great deal. I feel of the blame for this war must be laid at the doors of those nations, which were victorious in the last world war. And then  
Speaker 3    00:12:22    We want force is our leading policy. So far as we're concerned,  
Speaker 0    00:12:26    I said that we cannot kick Germany down and keep her down. There's always a possibility that we can keep her down. As we did not do that after the last world war, we kicked her down, but we let her get back up. Then may I ask one question to those people who are here? Do you believe it's Christian? Or do you believe it's even decent or democratic to carry on that sort of a policy toward of a ordination? I don't think so. I don't think it's good sense. It doesn't seem practical.  
Speaker 3    00:12:48    I think our fights with the German government, not with the German people,  
Speaker 2    00:12:52    I agree all that. Uh, but there wouldn't be any German government. If the German people didn't sanction that Hitler can't fight the war by himself, he can't form all the public opinions. Someone has put him there. Just the same. As all leaders are put there, they have to have a backing, someone behind him. They can't go out their bare fist and say, come on, boys, all of you follow me.  
Speaker 3    00:13:13    Well then again, you gotta look at, at the Germany, which resulted from what we did and what we didn't carry out because Hitler himself is a product of, we might say of what we, as an entire group of nations did, then German people when you're ready for  
Speaker 2    00:13:29    Something there, but you certainly  
Speaker 3    00:13:30    Naturally they're going vote in  
Speaker 2    00:13:31    Hitler, out on a little space of its own and say, he's the cause of all this that  
Speaker 3    00:13:36    Well, nobody is that. No,  
Speaker 0    00:13:38    You can't. You can't hope when I say to care to kick Germany and keep her down, what will you do? I mean, you can't wipe out an entire people, even Hitler's trial that found it extremely unsuccessful. So I think that a just and beneficial piece must come out of this. And furthermore, I believe this piece must be based thought of this armament policy. Well, do you don't think then that it will be wise no necessary for the United States to police the world so to speak after this war's over? Why? No, I think that's going back to the dark ages.  
Speaker 3    00:14:06    Mike, I disagree with you. I thought you were getting it. Another point when I said force, I meant that as an immediate step towards reconstruction, you would've necessity. He had have to use force. Otherwise you'd have the same thing reoccurring. And that's what we didn't do.  
Speaker 0    00:14:20    If you have an international police force, which apparently the United States is going to supply, then you're simply going to leave the world one way.
