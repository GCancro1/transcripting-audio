	Speaker 0: I (99.00%) think (98.00%) that (99.00%) people (99.00%) believe (69.00%) that (94.00%) could (97.00%) be (98.00%) due (95.00%) to (93.00%) that (70.00%) they're (51.00%) getting (86.00%), they're (69.00%) not (76.00%) getting (77.00%) enough (84.00%) hours (85.00%), that (86.00%) they (87.00%) might (83.00%) decide (40.00%) a (88.00%) certain (92.00%) job (97.00%), or (98.00%) if (94.00%) they (95.00%) are (72.00%) doing (97.00%) overtime (85.00%), sacrifice (94.00%) time (94.00%) with (90.00%) their (95.00%) family (56.00%). Uh (95.00%), then (98.00%) that (99.00%) could (100.00%) also (100.00%) be (100.00%) a (100.00%) reason (100.00%), but (54.00%) they (97.00%) would (99.00%) leave (99.00%) their (100.00%) job (98.00%). If (100.00%) the (100.00%) pay (100.00%) is (98.00%) too (99.00%) low (100.00%), their (97.00%) job (100.00%), if (95.00%) there (98.00%) is (97.00%), uh (51.00%), conflict (98.00%) with (83.00%) a (73.00%) coworker (56.00%), then (99.00%) they (100.00%) could (99.00%) also (100.00%) leave (100.00%) their (99.00%) job (100.00%). They (99.00%) are (89.00%) not (100.00%) satisfied (100.00%) with (100.00%) their (100.00%) job (100.00%). Uh (91.00%), um (52.00%), I (99.00%) think (100.00%) that (98.00%) the (100.00%) main (100.00%) reason (100.00%) why (88.00%) I (99.00%) want (95.00%) to (96.00%) stay (100.00%) in (100.00%) a (98.00%) job (100.00%). Okay (60.00%). I (55.00%), right (100.00%) now (100.00%) I (99.00%) really (100.00%) need (100.00%) money (100.00%). So (99.00%) the (100.00%) more (100.00%) money (100.00%) I (100.00%) can (100.00%) get (100.00%), the (100.00%) more (100.00%) likely (100.00%) it (100.00%) is (98.00%) that (99.00%) I (100.00%) would (97.00%) stay (91.00%) in (98.00%) a (97.00%) job (100.00%).
