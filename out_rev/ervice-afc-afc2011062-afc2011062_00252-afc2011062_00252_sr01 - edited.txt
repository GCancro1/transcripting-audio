Speaker 0    00:00:01    This is Bucky Hawker. I'm here at, uh, the iron workers union, local 63 headquarters. And, uh, tell me your name.  
Speaker 1    00:00:10    Uh, bud Martins. The real name is Henry Arnold. Martin's the third,  
Speaker 0    00:00:15    The third.  
Speaker 1    00:00:15    Yeah. And I have the fourth, fifth. My grandson is the fifth.  
Speaker 0    00:00:21    Oh, that's great.  
Speaker 1    00:00:22    Um,  
Speaker 0    00:00:24    And what year were you born?  
Speaker 1    00:00:26    I was born in, uh, 7/25/1940.  
Speaker 0    00:00:31    Okay. And were you born in Chicago then?  
Speaker 1    00:00:34    No. I'm one of the few that was born in, uh, log cabin in Kentucky.  
Speaker 0    00:00:41    A long. Where, where  
Speaker 1    00:00:42    In Kentucky in Mac bend Kentucky. It's about 10 miles out of Barbersville Kentucky.  
Speaker 0    00:00:50    So that only begs the question. How does it get from that log cabin?  
Speaker 1    00:00:55    Yeah, up here, my, my mother was from a farm down there and she had come up here to work at the world's fair in Chicago, Uhhuh <affirmative>. And my father was from here. He was from Maywood, they had Martin brothers, cold and ice. It was a large, at that time, it was a big industry, cold and ice. You have the ice all summer to cold, all winter <affirmative>. And, uh, he met, they met and from what I understand, he was a good tipper at the time. <laugh> and the two of 'em, uh, fell in love and they got married and my older sister was born up here and then they moved down there <affirmative> I was born. And then they realized to make a living. You had to be up here. Yeah. So they moved back up here. And, uh,  
Speaker 0    00:01:54    And did you live in Chicago or back to Maywood or?  
Speaker 1    00:01:56    Uh, we lived in Maywood for a short period of time, and then we moved to Bellwood <affirmative> and the house in Bellwood is still in the family, but after I married my wife, I moved a little further west of the park.  
Speaker 0    00:02:12    Okay. So, and then how did you get into the iron working trade  
Speaker 1    00:02:16    Into the iron working trade? I knew that I, at that time you had to be, um, very intelligent to even think about going to college. You had to be very book smart if you weren't from a wealthy, wealthy family. Yeah. The family wasn't that wealthy, but I, I knew when I got outta school, I wanted to make the most amount of money for my family that I could. And so when I went to, I went to proviso east and I went to, uh, trade school in improv proviso. I took all shop courses. I was gonna be a tool and dime maker. And, uh, what I did was when I got outta school, my grandfather had a, the cold yard still. And he was renting shop space to a tool and I company, and to a iron shop. And he said, uh, when I graduated, I could work for either one that I wanted.  
Speaker 1    00:03:35    You know, he says, either one I'll hire you, but just go over there. And I, when it, and I looked at the tool and die shop and I said, well, I know what I'll be doing there. I'll be doing, working on lays and working on milling machines and everything. And I said, um, what would I be doing at the iron shop? And he said, well, you'd be laying out jobs. You'll be, uh, putting jobs, other welding to jobs and, uh, put 'em on a truck, taking 'em out and delivering them. And I said, truck. I was a young guy. I was 18 at the time. And I said, if I on the truck, I says, I'm gonna work. Uh, told my grandpa was gonna work for the iron works. And I started out and I enjoyed it. I started out with Papa. The China works and I was a shock man.  
Speaker 1    00:04:32    And I enjoyed the work so much. And he actually went, went bankrupt. This is Popovich. Popovich, iron works, went bankrupt. And I had, because I was a young guy and I was making good money. I had, I had saved all my money and I lent him money. And he said he would give me the equipment to take and finish up the jobs in payment for what he, what I was owed. Yeah. And as long as my grandfather had the shop, I says, okay. So I went into business actually, when I was 19 and I made up all this, all the material. And then I called the local. I talked to, uh, moon Martin. Oh yeah. I saw something in here from moon. Yeah. Yeah. I said, I had my dad talk to him and said, my son is just starting out and we're gonna install this. And he needs a permit to do it. And I got a permit from him to take an install. And then with the understanding that as I developed and got bigger, I would taken higher. I, from that, I, I was young and foolish. And what I did was I finished the jobs. I had a big pile of money and I bought a boat and I went on vacation. <laugh>, that's what, that's what young people do when they're not yeah. Thinking straight.
