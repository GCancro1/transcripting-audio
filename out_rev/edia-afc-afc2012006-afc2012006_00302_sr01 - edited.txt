Speaker 1    00:02:59    Or, yeah, that's what it was. Uh, I wanted, uh, more security. Yeah. And, uh, I didn't really feel like music was gonna be a good future for me. Um, unless I really put my nose to grindstone and, uh, and, uh, so I sat, did I go back to sea? And of course my father was a seaman.  
Speaker 0    00:03:22    Oh, okay. Well, that was also was how did, how did you get interested in, in the water?  
Speaker 1    00:03:29    Yeah, my, uh, I have a very strong background, a maritime family that my, uh, I have an uncle father, cousin, and, uh, also stepfather went to see and, um,  
Speaker 0    00:03:41    All in the Navy or  
Speaker 1    00:03:43    A merch  
Speaker 0    00:03:43    Marine merch, Marine, oh,  
Speaker 1    00:03:45    Merch Marine. And, uh, I, I joined the, the Navy reserve when I was in high school and I went to the Navy, uh, after I had a year in college. So, uh, I decided I'd go back to sea. And so I did, I started off from, uh, uh, ground zero there. I started off as an ordinary semen mm-hmm <affirmative> and, uh, I worked my way all the way up. Uh, got my license in, uh, 1978, went to page, uh, navigation school in new Orleans. Oh, okay. And I studied to be a, a navigated third ma mm-hmm <affirmative> and got my license. And I transferred over from, uh, um, the, uh, unlicensed department into the license department. Mm-hmm <affirmative> and became a deck officer mm-hmm <affirmative>. And, uh, from there I moved up until, uh, 1991. <affirmative> I put an application here at Houston pilots and got accepted.  
Speaker 0    00:04:45    Oh, okay. So,  
Speaker 1    00:04:46    Uh, and 20 years now here at the Houston pilots.  
Speaker 0    00:04:51    Well now is, um, when you say you started out as a ordinary semen, I mean, is this in the merchant Marines or where  
Speaker 1    00:04:58    Merchant Marines. Okay. That's the, uh, the lawyers decorating.  
Speaker 0    00:05:02    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:05:03    And, um, I, uh, had a little Navy time, so I was able to take an exam, uh, to get what's called an able Bodi semen, um, difference between able Bodi semen and an, an ordinary semen is, uh, the able Bodi semen is a, is a skilled deck mm-hmm <affirmative> uh, whereas the ordinary semen is an apprentice mm-hmm <affirmative>. So, um, I was able to take the exam mm-hmm <affirmative> and, um, with the exam it's called a, a, uh, blue ticket, what it is, uh, you're a training a or training able Bodi, semen mm-hmm <affirmative>. So, um, I still on the ship of one year mm-hmm <affirmative> and that, uh, we respecting that I got my full ticket, a everybody seamen mm-hmm <affirmative> I sail for three years as everybody seamen. And, uh, I had enough time to, uh, um, sit for my, my ma license.  
Speaker 1    00:05:54    So that's when I went to school with new Orleans and, uh, studied and took the coast guard exam to become a third mate. Uh, each time you advance, uh, in your endorsements or documentation or license is through exams mm-hmm <affirmative> coast guard, exams, mm-hmm <affirmative>. And the main requirement, uh, is, will see time. So that, uh, that opens the door for, um, anyone who's, uh, I'd say has enough ambition mm-hmm <affirmative>, mm-hmm <affirmative> to, uh, want to better themselves. Uh, the roadblock are minimal mm-hmm <affirmative>, uh, it's all about which you're willing to, to, um, to put forth mm-hmm <affirmative> and study mm-hmm <affirmative> so, uh, the door was open for me and I took it  
Speaker 0    00:06:45    Well. Now, when you went to the academy, um, I mean, I know there are several acade. What Santo has an academy and Texas a and M I mean, I assume there are, yeah. Several all around. How long do you go? I mean, and what is the amount of time? Those  
Speaker 1    00:06:59    Are, those are four year academies. Those are the merchant Marine academies. Um, you it's like a normal college. Oh, okay. And, uh, you, you, you go there with virtue, no experience, you just apply and get accepted and you go to school, become, uh, a deck officer or an engineer.  
Speaker 0    00:07:18    And, and are you, you're studying just all maritime related, uh, courses or, or areas for four years?  
Speaker 1    00:07:27    Yes, but that's, that's not the route I took. Okay. Uh, the route I took was on the job training in  
Speaker 0    00:07:33    District city.  
Speaker 1    00:07:33    Okay. Yeah. I call it hog pipes. Mm-hmm <affirmative> I, uh, went to see, and I got the time, so become an officer. I went to navigation school, which was about six months along. Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:07:45    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:07:45    Okay. And it prepped me to, uh, uh, all the functions of being a navigator mm-hmm <affirmative> and also to take the exams mm-hmm <affirmative> so, um, it was a little different route mm-hmm  
Speaker 0    00:07:56    <affirmative> well, yeah, it sounded like, um, Lindy also, I mean, did it through experience, I mean, today, now do, what is the breakdown of people who are say pilots now? I mean, how many come up through sort of the academy route and how many come up through just on the job training?  
Speaker 1    00:08:20    Uh, I'd say now, probably about, uh, 85% of the pilots, uh, coming through an academy in maybe 90. Wow. Okay. Um, the, um, industry's changed. Um, the, the availability of education has changed. Mm-hmm <affirmative> um, I mean, I was starting out, I didn't know anything about academies mm-hmm <affirmative>, uh, I just wanted to go to see. Yeah. And as, as I, uh, went to see, I saw things that were open yeah. Doors that open for me. And, but, uh, now, uh, we've, we've set up, um, counseling, um, going into the high schools and, uh, and also the, uh, the junior high schools and, uh, giving seminars. Oh, really about, uh, the maritime industry and showing these kids there, uh, the routes they can take Uhhuh <affirmative>. So when they come outta school, they have an awareness of what's available for 'em out here. Mm-hmm <affirmative>. So the academies of, um, have picked up and, uh, you're getting more, more academy garage now than just the regular horse pipes. Oh,  
Speaker 0    00:09:33    Interesting. Now is set. I mean, would you go and talk to the schools or people from the academies go and talk  
Speaker 1    00:09:40    Or, uh, we talk matter of fact. Yeah. Uh, it's several schools I've, uh, given them lectures on, uh, career days about, uh, maritime industry. Uh, and the options opened up to 'em the maritime academies. And at one time we were, were gonna start a program. Uh, we had gotten with the, uh, local, some local, uh, congressmen, and we were gonna start a program to, uh, work on scholarships, uh, to bring kids into academies. Uh, but that, uh, the program got sidetracked, cuz there were, there were other priorities that came in focus mm-hmm <affirmative> but uh, that's still the back burner.
