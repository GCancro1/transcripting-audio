	Speaker 1: Mr (95.00%). Rossick (49.00%) what (95.00%) do (99.00%) you (99.00%) think (100.00%) about (100.00%) Japan's (100.00%) action (100.00%) last (100.00%) Sunday (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: I (100.00%) think (100.00%) they (100.00%) were (100.00%) all (100.00%) wrong (94.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (99.00%), for (100.00%) what (99.00%) reason (100.00%) do (99.00%) you (100.00%) think (100.00%) there (83.00%) was (98.00%) any (99.00%) justification (100.00%)? Whatever (99.00%) on (99.00%) the (89.00%) part (99.00%) of (96.00%) Japan (100.00%) for (59.00%) making (99.00%) out (52.00%) attack (30.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (100.00%) there (99.00%) was (93.00%) any (99.00%), 

	Speaker 1: What (77.00%) do (96.00%) you (99.00%) think (100.00%) the (97.00%) United States (98.00%) should (99.00%) have (74.00%) done (100.00%)? They (22.00%) in (44.00%) 

	Speaker 2: To (43.00%) declare (73.00%) war (89.00%) on (70.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: You (95.00%) were (94.00%), in (99.00%) other (98.00%) words (99.00%), you (98.00%) were (73.00%) behind (99.00%) Roosevelt's (100.00%) resolution (100.00%), 

	Speaker 2: Huh (94.00%)? Hundred (97.00%) percent (96.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (53.00%), that's (98.00%) good (93.00%). Do (83.00%) you (99.00%) think (99.00%) that (93.00%) all (99.00%) America (99.00%) has (96.00%) fallen (98.00%)? I (59.00%) mean (90.00%), all (99.00%) of (89.00%) your (99.00%) associates (100.00%) have (79.00%) fallen (97.00%) in (98.00%) pretty (99.00%) well (99.00%) behind (99.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Far (98.00%) as (98.00%) I (99.00%) can (99.00%) see (99.00%) all (99.00%) of (98.00%) them (62.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Do (88.00%) you (95.00%) hear (94.00%) much (98.00%) talk (98.00%) around (99.00%) them (27.00%), your (82.00%) job (71.00%) on (96.00%) you're (68.00%) a (82.00%) carpenter (100.00%) aren't (99.00%) 

	Speaker 2: You (92.00%)? Yes (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Finisher (87.00%). 

	Speaker 2: They (65.00%), uh (55.00%), right (86.00%). Smart (90.00%) talk (85.00%). 

	Speaker 1: What (79.00%) seems (95.00%) to (99.00%) be (99.00%) the (99.00%) general (97.00%) opinion (100.00%) amongst (100.00%) the (98.00%) carpenter's (100.00%) union (100.00%) man (90.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (100.00%), they (98.00%) all (98.00%) battle (41.00%) like (97.00%) me (97.00%). They (91.00%) think (100.00%) it's (99.00%) right (99.00%) for (78.00%) United States (100.00%) and (66.00%) declare (6.00%) war (62.00%). 

	Speaker 1: They (98.00%) seem (94.00%) to (98.00%) have (99.00%) any (93.00%) opinion (99.00%) as (98.00%) to (97.00%) who's (98.00%) gonna (88.00%) win (100.00%) or (62.00%) who's (98.00%) gonna (84.00%) lose (99.00%). 

	Speaker 2: Well (100.00%), uh (69.00%), some (100.00%) of (99.00%) 'em (79.00%) seems (47.00%) to (98.00%) think (99.00%) that (93.00%) they're (90.00%) going (69.00%) last (100.00%) on (77.00%), but (99.00%) I'm (82.00%) of (56.00%) a (73.00%) different (99.00%) opinion (100.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) it's (98.00%) gonna (63.00%) last (100.00%) quite (100.00%) a (100.00%) while (90.00%). 

	Speaker 1: How (100.00%) come (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (100.00%), because (46.00%) United States (94.00%) is (72.00%) gonna (48.00%) first (99.00%) have (81.00%) to (78.00%) corner (90.00%) him (94.00%). 

	Speaker 1: <laugh> (82.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Just (98.00%) like (99.00%) a (93.00%) dog (87.00%) catching (100.00%) a (75.00%) rabbit (95.00%). You've (99.00%) got (47.00%) catch (100.00%) him (80.00%) before (99.00%) you (67.00%) can (93.00%) kill (99.00%) him (96.00%). 

	Speaker 1: That's (99.00%) right (98.00%). It's (82.00%) gonna (86.00%) be (98.00%) some (91.00%) problem (98.00%). Catch (99.00%) him (80.00%) out (99.00%) there (96.00%) in (97.00%) the (69.00%) Pacific (93.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Ocean (94.00%). That's (98.00%) right (99.00%). That's (98.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Right (98.00%). Do (83.00%) you (96.00%) think (99.00%) maybe (97.00%) Germany (98.00%) had (99.00%) any (95.00%) hand (93.00%) in (77.00%) this (64.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: I (99.00%) believe (100.00%) Hitler (99.00%) had (98.00%) direct (60.00%) contact (99.00%) in (70.00%) that (64.00%) 

	Speaker 1: He's (93.00%) one (77.00%) that (53.00%) instigate (97.00%). 

	Speaker 2: I (93.00%) believe (94.00%) that (93.00%). Right (66.00%). 

	Speaker 1: What (97.00%) do (98.00%) you (98.00%) think (99.00%) about (98.00%) Russia's (93.00%) partying (59.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (100.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (100.00%) Russia's (93.00%) got (99.00%) anything (100.00%) to (98.00%) do (99.00%) with (99.00%) it (78.00%). 

	Speaker 1: I (99.00%) mean (99.00%), though (87.00%), do (99.00%) you (99.00%) think (99.00%) Russia's (94.00%) gonna (65.00%) give (99.00%) us (98.00%) a (98.00%) hand (99.00%)? Do (57.00%) you (96.00%) think (97.00%) she's (93.00%) gonna (92.00%) support (98.00%) us (98.00%) or (99.00%) is (84.00%) she (92.00%) going (30.00%) to (78.00%), 

	Speaker 2: Well (98.00%), to (94.00%) be (99.00%) honest (100.00%) with (98.00%) you (98.00%), I (99.00%), uh (85.00%), wouldn't (99.00%) trust (100.00%) them (76.00%) too (97.00%) far (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: You (53.00%) wouldn't (97.00%) trust (97.00%) Russia (81.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Not (83.00%), not (92.00%) too (98.00%) far (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (79.00%), why (99.00%) do (96.00%) you (98.00%) reckon (99.00%) Japan (99.00%) wanted (98.00%) to (96.00%) do (96.00%) such (56.00%) cool (51.00%) things (92.00%) attack (61.00%) the (56.00%) United States (82.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (95.00%), just (91.00%) Listening (95.00%) it (49.00%) Hitler (99.00%), that's (97.00%) my (97.00%) opinion (98.00%). 

	Speaker 1: And (56.00%) in (46.00%) other (92.00%) words (92.00%), it (95.00%) wasn't (97.00%) their (92.00%) own (84.00%), wasn't (93.00%) their (89.00%) own (88.00%) deciding (91.00%) know (41.00%), 

	Speaker 2: Not (94.00%) totally (98.00%). 

	Speaker 1: I (96.00%) don't (96.00%) believe (90.00%), uh (53.00%), what (80.00%) you (97.00%) think (98.00%) about (96.00%) Japan (98.00%) preparation (100.00%). Do (90.00%) you (94.00%) think (94.00%) I'd (89.00%) like (91.00%) to (61.00%) kinda (50.00%) summarize (97.00%) that (96.00%) by (90.00%) that (92.00%)? I (91.00%) mean (88.00%), why (54.00%), how (88.00%) is (77.00%) Japan (82.00%) Japan (95.00%) prepared (74.00%) for (76.00%) more (67.00%)? You (74.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: I (89.00%) don't (93.00%) think (89.00%) the (33.00%) prepared (75.00%) to (65.00%), they (99.00%) might (99.00%) think (100.00%) they (99.00%) are (94.00%), but (98.00%) I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (100.00%) they (94.00%) last (100.00%) over (100.00%) two (100.00%) years (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: You (73.00%) mean (75.00%) a (27.00%) collapse (73.00%) in (43.00%)

	Speaker 1: Well (86.00%), what (95.00%) about (95.00%) the (83.00%) United States (91.00%) though (67.00%)? How (99.00%) well (99.00%) prepared (98.00%) is (97.00%) she (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (99.00%), I (88.00%) believe (42.00%) she's (98.00%) as (98.00%) well (100.00%) prepared (99.00%) as (94.00%) Japan (100.00%) and (99.00%), uh (68.00%), she (100.00%) can (99.00%) prepare (99.00%) faster (100.00%) now (100.00%) than (95.00%) Japan (100.00%). Can (87.00%). 

	Speaker 1: What (84.00%) do (99.00%) you (99.00%) think (99.00%) the (77.00%) labor (98.00%) ought (100.00%) to (64.00%) do (96.00%) about (99.00%) this (99.00%)? You (91.00%) know (92.00%), labor (97.00%) has (56.00%) been (97.00%) in (55.00%) the (69.00%) opinion (95.00%) of (98.00%) some (98.00%) people (100.00%) getting (98.00%) kind (88.00%) of (80.00%) a (89.00%) wrong (41.00%) deal (99.00%) and (71.00%) fixing (92.00%) get (25.00%) a (52.00%) pretty (64.00%) raw (68.00%) deal (83.00%), at (83.00%) least (85.00%) just (91.00%) before (79.00%) a (82.00%) while (75.00%). Was (50.00%) there (24.00%)? 

	Speaker 2: Well (99.00%), uh (79.00%), that's (99.00%) my (100.00%) opinion (99.00%). I (99.00%) think (98.00%) they (81.00%) didn't (92.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) believe (100.00%) in (99.00%) strikes (100.00%) during (95.00%) this (99.00%), uh (84.00%), 

	Speaker 1: Emergency (71.00%)

And (98.00%) I (99.00%) think (99.00%) that (98.00%), uh (73.00%), do (95.00%) you (99.00%) think (99.00%) labor's (95.00%) gonna (83.00%) come (99.00%) out (92.00%) though (64.00%) ahead (95.00%) after (96.00%) this (99.00%) war (96.00%)? Do (87.00%) you (98.00%) think (97.00%) that (84.00%), uh (88.00%), in (99.00%) other (99.00%) words (100.00%), her (99.00%) rights (99.00%) will (91.00%) be (99.00%) protect (37.00%) protected (94.00%) labor (89.00%) man (61.00%), black (40.00%) to (54.00%) be (90.00%) protected (95.00%)
