	Speaker 1: This (99.00%) is (98.00%) Wednesday (100.00%), December 10th, 1941 (77.00%) last (100.00%) Sunday (100.00%), three (100.00%) days (100.00%) ago (100.00%) on (100.00%) December 7th (97.00%), the (100.00%) United States of America (100.00%) was (100.00%) attacked (100.00%) by (100.00%) armed (100.00%) forces (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) Japanese (100.00%) empire (100.00%), Indiana (98.00%) university (100.00%) and (93.00%) cooperation (100.00%) with (100.00%) the (81.00%) library (99.00%) of (100.00%) Congress (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (51.00%) United States (100.00%) has (75.00%) arranged (100.00%) to (90.00%) record (74.00%) some (98.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) opinion (75.00%) of (77.00%) five (75.00%) representative (98.00%) students (98.00%) concerning (99.00%) the (99.00%) war (98.00%). At (93.00%) this (99.00%) point (100.00%), these (99.00%) students (100.00%), we (100.00%) believe (100.00%), uh (86.00%), have (100.00%) opinions (100.00%) which (94.00%) should (100.00%) be (100.00%) taken (99.00%) into (99.00%) consideration (100.00%) because (99.00%) they (99.00%) are (98.00%) the (98.00%) people (100.00%) who (99.00%) will (99.00%) be (100.00%) bearing (99.00%) the (95.00%) brunt (100.00%) of (100.00%) this (100.00%) war (99.00%). Uh (81.00%), after (100.00%) the (100.00%) war (100.00%) actually (100.00%) gets (100.00%) underway (100.00%). Uh (86.00%), first (100.00%) I (97.00%) have (98.00%) up (86.00%) on (49.00%) my (99.00%) right (98.00%) Mr (80.00%). Mike Fox (99.00%), uh (86.00%), a (84.00%) soft (95.00%) more (52.00%) Mr (90.00%). Fox (99.00%), uh (86.00%), tell (99.00%) us (100.00%) just (99.00%), uh (72.00%), nearly (99.00%) as (100.00%) you (100.00%) can (100.00%), just (99.00%) what (100.00%) you (100.00%) thought (99.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) war (100.00%) when (100.00%) you (100.00%) heard (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (100.00%) declaration (100.00%) of (100.00%) war (100.00%) by (100.00%) Japan (100.00%). I (66.00%), I (99.00%) mean (100.00%) the (100.00%) attack (51.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) Japanese (100.00%) planes (99.00%) upon (90.00%) Pearl (100.00%) Harbor (100.00%) last (100.00%) Sunday (100.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) was (100.00%) stunned (99.00%) at (96.00%) first (99.00%). I (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) believe (100.00%) it (81.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Did (81.00%) not (96.00%) believe (99.00%) it (97.00%) first (99.00%). Well (98.00%), after (47.00%) that (96.00%), uh (43.00%), period (98.00%), uh (59.00%), left (93.00%) you (90.00%), then (97.00%), what (100.00%) did (98.00%) you (100.00%) think (100.00%) about (100.00%), well (40.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I'd (86.00%) say (84.00%) it (82.00%) was (99.00%) one (92.00%) of (70.00%) feeling (99.00%) of (97.00%) fury (100.00%) and (95.00%) anger (100.00%) that (99.00%) we (99.00%) had (95.00%) been (100.00%) betrayed (100.00%) 

	Speaker 1: That (83.00%) you (59.00%) had (90.00%) been (100.00%) betrayed (100.00%) by (100.00%) the (99.00%) peaceman (77.00%) wound (38.00%) negotiators (100.00%) in (59.00%) Washington (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (99.00%) time (100.00%) that (97.00%) the (100.00%), uh (56.00%), actual (99.00%) attack (100.00%) did (100.00%) take (100.00%) place (54.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Yes (87.00%), 

	Speaker 2: I (100.00%) think (100.00%), uh (90.00%), I (99.00%) think (100.00%), uh (88.00%), our (100.00%), uh (69.00%), secretary (100.00%) of (100.00%) state (100.00%) must (97.00%) have (82.00%) been (100.00%) asleep (98.00%) if (95.00%) we (100.00%) were (100.00%) betrayed (100.00%). Certainly (99.00%), uh (87.00%), if (71.00%) we (98.00%) need (99.00%) somebody (99.00%) in (97.00%) the (54.00%) Naval (100.00%) intelligence (100.00%) core (53.00%) to (100.00%) kind (76.00%) of (76.00%) find (100.00%) out (100.00%) what's (100.00%) going (100.00%) on (100.00%), if (99.00%) we (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) know (100.00%) what (100.00%) was (100.00%) going (100.00%) on (100.00%) prior (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (92.00%) attack (97.00%), 

	Speaker 1: I (100.00%) see (99.00%) Mr (95.00%). Uh (77.00%), Roy (67.00%) believes (93.00%) that (20.00%) Boyer (35.00%), Mr (95.00%). Boyer (77.00%) believes (96.00%) that (93.00%) we (99.00%) were (99.00%) asleep (100.00%) miss (65.00%) Fargo (79.00%). 

	Speaker 3: And (100.00%) yet (100.00%) don't (100.00%) you (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (75.00%) at (94.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) time (99.00%) that (95.00%) perhaps (100.00%) it (99.00%) wasn't (100.00%) a (99.00%) matter (100.00%) of (100.00%) there (93.00%) being (99.00%) sleep (89.00%), but (96.00%) rather (100.00%) of (99.00%) holding (99.00%) out (95.00%) to (94.00%) the (100.00%) very (100.00%) end (100.00%) and (98.00%) maintaining (100.00%) an (99.00%) American (100.00%) policy (100.00%), which (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (84.00%) attempted (100.00%) to (100.00%) follow (92.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) agree (99.00%) with (99.00%) miss (56.00%) Fargo (93.00%) very (100.00%) much (100.00%). We (100.00%) weren't (99.00%) asleep (98.00%) after (100.00%) all (99.00%) the (100.00%) Japanese (100.00%) asked (87.00%) for (59.00%) two (99.00%) extra (99.00%) weeks (100.00%) in (84.00%) negotiations (100.00%), believing (99.00%) this (97.00%) to (98.00%) be (98.00%) in (94.00%) the (87.00%) guise (83.00%) of (72.00%) friendship (100.00%) we (100.00%) did (100.00%). So (100.00%) they (77.00%) even (99.00%) sent (80.00%) another (98.00%) ambassador (100.00%), Mr (98.00%). Caruso (56.00%), to (100.00%) interview (100.00%) the (99.00%) presence (52.00%), the (63.00%) secretary (99.00%) of (98.00%) state (99.00%), and (92.00%) after (94.00%) all (77.00%) under (82.00%) disguise (77.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (99.00%) we (97.00%) could (78.00%) say (99.00%) anything (100.00%) but (86.00%) treachery (98.00%). 

	Speaker 4: We (67.00%) could (97.00%) trust (99.00%) the (95.00%) Japanese (100.00%) or (99.00%) any (99.00%) other (97.00%) the (98.00%) excess (78.00%) power (96.00%) since (100.00%) 1939 (96.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Isn't (100.00%) it (99.00%) better (99.00%) to (100.00%) trust (100.00%). And (89.00%) to (99.00%) she (66.00%), the (100.00%) blood (100.00%) of (100.00%) so (99.00%) many (99.00%) millions (100.00%) of (100.00%) 

	Speaker 4: People (100.00%). Do (99.00%) you (100.00%) think (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) have (99.00%) not (100.00%) been (100.00%) at (99.00%) war (100.00%) with (99.00%) Japan (99.00%), Germany (100.00%), and (100.00%) Italy (66.00%) since (96.00%) 1939 (100.00%), we (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Have (99.00%) had (100.00%) a (35.00%) non (92.00%) belligerent (96.00%) status (99.00%) 

	Speaker 4: UNR (67.00%). In (99.00%) what (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Sense (90.00%) we (100.00%) have (99.00%) not (99.00%) actually (100.00%) engaged (99.00%) in (95.00%) armed (99.00%) conflict (100.00%) with (100.00%) either (99.00%) of (97.00%) these (100.00%) people (100.00%) 

	Speaker 4: And (86.00%) you're (99.00%) defining (100.00%) war (90.00%) merely (99.00%) as (68.00%) armed (100.00%) conflict (94.00%). Yes (99.00%), I (99.00%) am (98.00%). And (99.00%) you're (98.00%) willing (93.00%) to (100.00%) cry (57.00%) treachery (99.00%) and (96.00%) betrayal (100.00%) that (80.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) country (100.00%) gets (100.00%) a (95.00%) jump (100.00%) on (100.00%) us (96.00%). 

	Speaker 3: Oh (46.00%), Paul (99.00%), before (100.00%) we (100.00%) get (100.00%) off (100.00%) track (95.00%) here (99.00%), I (100.00%) wonder (100.00%), um (87.00%), getting (100.00%) back (100.00%) to (100.00%) your (94.00%) first (99.00%) question (100.00%), if (100.00%) any (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (100.00%) rest (100.00%) of (100.00%) you (100.00%) felt (100.00%) that (93.00%) Germany (100.00%) as (99.00%) a (96.00%) first (100.00%) reaction (100.00%) was (100.00%) behind (100.00%) this (100.00%) as (100.00%) a (100.00%) very (100.00%) well (100.00%) brought (62.00%) out (90.00%) well (100.00%) timed (97.00%) plan (99.00%) rather (100.00%) than (100.00%) Japan (100.00%) itself (100.00%) taking (100.00%) the (52.00%) lead (99.00%) on (100.00%) this (99.00%). Ms (42.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Flo (18.00%), what (97.00%) was (97.00%) your (97.00%) opinion (96.00%) about (99.00%) that (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 3: Well (100.00%), of (99.00%) course (100.00%) 

	Speaker 5: It (99.00%) was (100.00%) a (97.00%) shock (96.00%). We (100.00%) just (100.00%) got (100.00%) in (99.00%) from (100.00%) a (99.00%) hike (99.00%) Sunday (99.00%) afternoon (100.00%) along (99.00%) came (98.00%) these (100.00%) headlines (100.00%), that (99.00%) war (99.00%) had (100.00%) been (100.00%) declared (100.00%) on (97.00%) the (99.00%) United States (100.00%) by (100.00%) Japan (100.00%). I (100.00%) got (100.00%) sort (95.00%) of (98.00%) confused (100.00%) and (99.00%) told (100.00%) a (86.00%) Jewish (100.00%) dialect (100.00%) story (100.00%) to (100.00%) a (99.00%) bunch (100.00%) of (100.00%) Jewish (100.00%) students (100.00%). And (88.00%) 

	Speaker 3: Then (98.00%) we (99.00%) 

	Speaker 5: Thought (78.00%) things (99.00%) over (100.00%) a (95.00%) while (83.00%), but (100.00%) it (78.00%), it (95.00%) just (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) seem (100.00%) right (100.00%) that (97.00%) Japan (100.00%) should (100.00%) be (100.00%) the (100.00%) one (100.00%) to (97.00%) make (100.00%) the (100.00%) attack (100.00%). I (100.00%) would've (100.00%) expected (100.00%) an (100.00%) attack (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) Atlantic (100.00%) first (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (99.00%) now (99.00%), um (69.00%), since (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (94.00%) some (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) attitudes (100.00%), which (94.00%), uh (79.00%), some (99.00%) of (99.00%) you (99.00%) had (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (100.00%) time (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%), uh (80.00%), when (100.00%) you (100.00%) heard (100.00%) of (95.00%) the (100.00%), uh (83.00%), attack (100.00%) by (99.00%) Japan (100.00%), uh (82.00%), I'd (98.00%) like (100.00%) to (100.00%) get (100.00%) just (99.00%) what (100.00%) some (100.00%) of (99.00%) your (99.00%) attitudes (100.00%) were (99.00%) concerning (100.00%) our (99.00%) foreign (100.00%) policy (100.00%) before (100.00%) this (100.00%) bombing (100.00%). In (100.00%) other (100.00%) words (100.00%), whether (100.00%) or (100.00%) not (100.00%) your (100.00%) attitudes (100.00%) were (100.00%) drastically (100.00%) changed (100.00%) by (100.00%) this (100.00%) bombing (100.00%), Mr (94.00%). Fox (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Well (92.00%), I (100.00%) was (100.00%) definitely (100.00%) a (100.00%) cooperation (97.00%) before (100.00%) this (100.00%). I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) believe (100.00%) an (56.00%) isolation (100.00%) never (98.00%) have (99.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Cooperation (99.00%). Is (1.00%) there (41.00%), would (99.00%) you (99.00%) tell (100.00%) us (99.00%) what (75.00%) a (87.00%) cooperation (93.00%)? 

	Speaker 0: Well (98.00%), I (95.00%), I (93.00%) believe (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) should (99.00%) work (99.00%) in (99.00%) concert (99.00%) with (98.00%) the (99.00%) other (100.00%) democratic (100.00%) nation (100.00%) of (97.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%). Long (99.00%). I (100.00%) have (99.00%) felt (100.00%) that (74.00%) the (97.00%) difficulty (99.00%) of (64.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%) has (99.00%) been (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (95.00%), after (99.00%) framing (100.00%) the (100.00%) idea (100.00%) of (69.00%) the (94.00%) league (60.00%) nations (99.00%) dropped (93.00%) out (93.00%) of (93.00%) it (99.00%). Uh (90.00%), since (100.00%) the (100.00%) war (100.00%) broke (100.00%) out (99.00%) in (87.00%) 1939 (99.00%), I (100.00%) have (100.00%) felt (100.00%) that (99.00%) we (100.00%) should (100.00%) give (100.00%) England (100.00%) and (99.00%) later (100.00%) Russia (99.00%), every (99.00%) assistance (94.00%) short (99.00%) of (100.00%) war (100.00%). Now (100.00%), my (100.00%) feelings (100.00%) are (100.00%) exactly (100.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) in (65.00%), in (92.00%) it (94.00%). 

	Speaker 2: Think (99.00%) Mr (93.00%). Fox (100.00%) has (98.00%) been (100.00%) reading (100.00%) too (99.00%) many (100.00%) newspapers (98.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Cause (57.00%) 

	Speaker 2: That (97.00%), uh (87.00%), that (94.00%) is (99.00%) a (95.00%) traditional (100.00%) attitude (100.00%), the (98.00%) democratic (100.00%) nations (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%), which (97.00%), which (78.00%) there (97.00%) aren't (100.00%) any (100.00%) democratic (100.00%) nations (100.00%) outside (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%) and (100.00%) the (100.00%), uh (93.00%), we (100.00%) have (100.00%) cooperated (99.00%) economically (100.00%), but (100.00%) we (100.00%) are (99.00%) putting (95.00%), we (98.00%) are (98.00%) keeping (100.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) countries (100.00%) of (89.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%) on (99.00%), uh (83.00%), I (100.00%) can't (100.00%) express (100.00%) what (100.00%) I (99.00%) mean (89.00%) to (96.00%) say (100.00%), let (100.00%) someone (100.00%) else (99.00%) take (100.00%) over (99.00%) 

	Speaker 3: Paul (99.00%) from (100.00%) a (75.00%), from (94.00%) a (99.00%) student (100.00%) standpoint (100.00%). I (100.00%) wonder (100.00%) if (100.00%) we (100.00%) don't (100.00%) lean (100.00%) a (100.00%) little (100.00%) bit (99.00%) towards (100.00%), this (100.00%) is (50.00%) the (26.00%), actually (94.00%) when (100.00%) we (99.00%) heard (100.00%) the (100.00%) president (100.00%) speech (98.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) day (100.00%) and (89.00%) heard (99.00%) this (99.00%) unanimous (100.00%), uh (85.00%), enthusiastic (100.00%) reaction (100.00%) from (100.00%) our (100.00%) Congressman (100.00%), we've (100.00%) been (100.00%) brought (100.00%) up (100.00%) for (100.00%) the (100.00%) past (100.00%) 19 (100.00%) and (98.00%) 20 (100.00%) years (100.00%) to (100.00%) have (60.00%) H (51.00%) war (87.00%) and (86.00%) to (96.00%) treat (100.00%) it (91.00%) as (80.00%) something (100.00%) of (90.00%) that (100.00%) is (99.00%) not (100.00%) a (99.00%) part (100.00%) of (100.00%) our (100.00%) culture (100.00%). And (100.00%) then (99.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) past (100.00%) few (100.00%) years (100.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) believe (100.00%) we (100.00%) are (100.00%) too (48.00%) surprise (57.00%) at (78.00%) the (89.00%) Japanese (100.00%) action (99.00%) because (100.00%) we've (100.00%) seen (100.00%) what (100.00%) they've (100.00%) done (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) past (100.00%), and (100.00%) we've (100.00%) watched (100.00%) them (90.00%) fairly (100.00%) closely (100.00%), but (100.00%) weren't (100.00%), we (100.00%) a (46.00%), a (99.00%) little (100.00%) bit (99.00%) used (94.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) idea (97.00%) that (100.00%) we (100.00%) wanted (100.00%) to (100.00%) avoid (100.00%) everything (100.00%) at (97.00%) all (100.00%) costs (47.00%). And (100.00%) then (95.00%) this (65.00%) sudden (99.00%) foreign (100.00%) war (99.00%) policy (100.00%), uh (48.00%), thrown (72.00%) upon (98.00%) us (100.00%) was (97.00%) rather (100.00%) a (96.00%) shock (100.00%) to (93.00%) this (100.00%) generation (100.00%), as (26.00%) I (94.00%), for (97.00%) one (99.00%) was (99.00%) rather (100.00%) surprised (99.00%) at (75.00%) the (72.00%) Congressman (100.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) day (100.00%) cheering (100.00%). So (99.00%) enthusiastically (100.00%) and (100.00%) yep (63.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) if (100.00%) I (100.00%) were (100.00%) there (100.00%), I (100.00%) probably (100.00%) would've (99.00%) done (100.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) thing (98.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Yes (97.00%). The (100.00%) idea (100.00%), I (98.00%) think (97.00%), has (100.00%) been (100.00%) instilled (100.00%) into (98.00%) the (99.00%) minds (99.00%) of (100.00%) the (99.00%) youth (94.00%) of (99.00%) this (100.00%) country (100.00%) ever (100.00%) since (100.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%) war (100.00%), that (98.00%) that (81.00%) war (100.00%) is (99.00%) the (100.00%) greatest (100.00%) of (100.00%) all (100.00%) evils (100.00%) and (35.00%) Mr (93.00%). Fox (100.00%), getting (99.00%) back (100.00%) to (100.00%) what (100.00%) you (100.00%) said (100.00%) just (100.00%) a (100.00%) moment (100.00%) ago (100.00%), uh (92.00%), you (100.00%) said (96.00%) that (97.00%) you (100.00%) believed (100.00%), uh (83.00%), in (99.00%) helping (100.00%) great (100.00%) Britain (100.00%) and (92.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) democracies (99.00%) win (84.00%) this (99.00%) war (100.00%), uh (87.00%), by (100.00%) every (99.00%) means (60.00%), short (99.00%) of (100.00%) war (100.00%). In (99.00%) other (100.00%) words (100.00%), you (100.00%) do (99.00%) not (100.00%) feel (96.00%) that (95.00%) the (98.00%) United States (100.00%) is (96.00%) war (99.00%) with (51.00%) Germany (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (100.00%) present (98.00%) time (100.00%), to (100.00%) the (99.00%) same (99.00%) extent (100.00%) to (90.00%) which (98.00%) she (62.00%) is (90.00%) with (98.00%) Japan (100.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) would (100.00%) say (100.00%) morally (100.00%). Yes (99.00%), but (100.00%) looking (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (100.00%) problem (100.00%) realistically (100.00%) and (100.00%) practically (100.00%), I (100.00%) believe (100.00%) that (99.00%) as (97.00%) a (99.00%) military (100.00%) standpoint (100.00%), it (100.00%) is (99.00%) far (100.00%) better (100.00%) to (100.00%) fight (100.00%) on (100.00%) one (100.00%) front (97.00%) than (56.00%) on (99.00%) two (99.00%), by (100.00%) concentrating (100.00%) our (99.00%) efforts (100.00%) on (100.00%) Japan (100.00%). I (88.00%) have (51.00%) the (99.00%) opinion (92.00%) that (87.00%) we (100.00%) can (91.00%) knock (100.00%) her (81.00%) out (91.00%) of (95.00%) the (99.00%) war (100.00%) much (100.00%) more (100.00%) rapidly (98.00%) than (99.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%). If (100.00%) our (100.00%) efforts (100.00%) are (93.00%) split (100.00%) by (100.00%) an (96.00%) AE (68.00%) F (44.00%) for (100.00%) example (100.00%), Africa (99.00%) and (98.00%) an (82.00%) Atlantic (100.00%) fleet (100.00%), which (100.00%) must (100.00%) see (100.00%) action (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) Atlantic (100.00%), 

	Speaker 4: Don't (99.00%) forget (100.00%). That's (100.00%) just (99.00%) exactly (100.00%) what (100.00%) Hitler (100.00%) wants (99.00%) us (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%). If (100.00%) we (100.00%) concentrate (100.00%) entirely (100.00%) upon (96.00%) Japan (100.00%), then (87.00%) we (100.00%) must (97.00%) stop (98.00%) our (98.00%) flow (85.00%) of (100.00%) goods (100.00%) to (100.00%) great (99.00%) Britain (100.00%) and (98.00%) Russia (99.00%). And (94.00%) evidently (100.00%) the (99.00%) grand (98.00%) strategy (100.00%) back (100.00%) of (98.00%) the (100.00%) axis (67.00%) powers (99.00%) is (100.00%) to (100.00%), uh (67.00%), divert (100.00%) our (99.00%) flow (75.00%) of (92.00%) material (95.00%). 

	Speaker 5: But (96.00%) according (99.00%) to (99.00%) what (99.00%) the (99.00%) president (99.00%) said (99.00%) in (99.00%) his (99.00%) speech (100.00%) last (99.00%) night (99.00%), he (100.00%) is (96.00%) intending (100.00%) to (100.00%) continue (100.00%) our (99.00%) shipments (100.00%) to (100.00%) Russia (99.00%). And (100.00%) to (90.00%) England (99.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I'd (100.00%) like (100.00%) to (100.00%) call (100.00%) him (65.00%) as (31.00%) FO's (90.00%) attention (100.00%). The (99.00%) fact (100.00%) that (99.00%) the (100.00%) only (100.00%) road (100.00%) left (100.00%) to (99.00%) Russia (100.00%) is (100.00%) now (99.00%) the (100.00%) road (99.00%) through (99.00%) Persia (99.00%). Since (96.00%) a (93.00%) lot (99.00%) of (99.00%) us (76.00%) stock (91.00%) lies (37.00%) behind (100.00%) the (99.00%) Japanese (100.00%) archipelago (87.00%). Therefore (100.00%) I (100.00%) believe (100.00%) that (100.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) help (100.00%) Russia (100.00%) by (98.00%) sending (87.00%) all (66.00%) these (90.00%) supplies (100.00%) to (97.00%) Persia (99.00%). But (100.00%) if (100.00%) we (100.00%) do (100.00%) get (100.00%) into (99.00%) the (100.00%) war (100.00%) with (100.00%) Germany (100.00%), it (100.00%) means (100.00%) splitting (100.00%) our (99.00%) resources (100.00%) and (94.00%) justice (59.00%). Germany (99.00%) did (100.00%) not (100.00%) want (99.00%) to (97.00%) fight (100.00%) on (100.00%) more (99.00%) than (100.00%) one (99.00%) front (97.00%), neither (100.00%) should (100.00%) we (99.00%), 

	Speaker 3: In (100.00%) regard (100.00%) to (100.00%) that (100.00%), we (100.00%) don't (100.00%) even (100.00%) know (100.00%) Russia (99.00%) stand (38.00%) yet (100.00%). 

	Speaker 2: Yes (30.00%). In (93.00%) Germany (100.00%), uh (76.00%), Germany (100.00%) is (98.00%) the (99.00%) base (99.00%) for (99.00%) the (100.00%) whole (100.00%) thing (100.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) that (42.00%) we (92.00%) should (96.00%) get (100.00%) at (95.00%) the (99.00%) base (100.00%) of (100.00%) this (99.00%) thing (95.00%) instead (100.00%) of (94.00%) going (100.00%) around (86.00%) the (97.00%) fringes (100.00%) and (98.00%) taking (99.00%) the (100.00%) longest (100.00%) way (99.00%) and (96.00%) just (99.00%) go (99.00%) to (99.00%) the (98.00%) base (86.00%) and (99.00%), uh (88.00%), wipe (99.00%) that (100.00%) out (100.00%). And (99.00%) then (98.00%) the (100.00%) whole (100.00%) thing (100.00%) will (99.00%) be (100.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Solved (93.00%). Then (94.00%) you (100.00%) would (99.00%) favor (100.00%) an (94.00%) immediate (100.00%) declaration (100.00%) of (99.00%) war (98.00%). Yes (47.00%). Germany (100.00%) 

	Speaker 3: That's (93.00%) right (94.00%). Well (98.00%), it (99.00%) hasn't (100.00%) been (100.00%) our (97.00%) policy (100.00%) in (99.00%) the (100.00%) past (100.00%) to (97.00%) do (92.00%) that (49.00%). 

	Speaker 2: Well (87.00%), I (83.00%), I (91.00%) think (99.00%) we've (99.00%), uh (81.00%), gone (96.00%) too (95.00%) much (100.00%) on (99.00%) tradition (100.00%) now (98.00%) and (96.00%) that's (98.00%), uh (69.00%), Reese (37.00%) and (79.00%) this (98.00%) Pearl (100.00%) Harbor (100.00%) incident (97.00%) has (90.00%) come (99.00%) out (100.00%). We (100.00%) have (93.00%) thought (99.00%) of (99.00%) this (99.00%) non-combatant (99.00%) tradition (100.00%) of (91.00%) the (94.00%) United States (89.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) we (100.00%) should (99.00%) quit (93.00%) fooling (99.00%) around (99.00%) with (100.00%) ideologies (99.00%) and (99.00%) get (99.00%) down (100.00%) to (99.00%) actual (99.00%) fighting (100.00%) and (99.00%) what (100.00%) is (97.00%) really (100.00%) happening (100.00%) here (99.00%) in (99.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%). 

	Speaker 5: Don't (97.00%) but (90.00%) the (99.00%) more (100.00%) time (99.00%) we (100.00%) have (97.00%) before (100.00%) we (100.00%) go (99.00%) to (99.00%) war (91.00%) was (74.00%) Germany (100.00%), the (98.00%) more (100.00%) war (100.00%) planes (98.00%) we (100.00%) have (97.00%), the (99.00%) more (100.00%) equipment (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (99.00%), the (100.00%) better (100.00%) preparation (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%). If (100.00%) we (100.00%) can (99.00%) put (100.00%) it (99.00%) off (99.00%) two (100.00%) weeks (99.00%), then (86.00%) we (99.00%) have (95.00%) just (99.00%) two (100.00%) weeks (88.00%) advantage (100.00%) on (99.00%) supply (93.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I'd (100.00%) like (100.00%) to (100.00%) make (100.00%) just (99.00%) one (100.00%) more (100.00%) point (100.00%). And (97.00%) that (99.00%) is (99.00%) that (96.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) no (99.00%) common (100.00%) battlefield (100.00%) to (86.00%) meet (76.00%) Germany (100.00%) on (98.00%) against (99.00%) Japan (100.00%). It (99.00%) is (96.00%) true (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) meet (100.00%) them (100.00%) at (98.00%) sea (99.00%) since (100.00%) they (100.00%) have (100.00%) a (98.00%) Navy (100.00%). And (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) also (100.00%) Germany (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) other (100.00%) hand (94.00%) has (99.00%) virtually (100.00%) no (99.00%) Navy (100.00%) would (67.00%) have (94.00%) to (99.00%) send (100.00%) an (98.00%) a (97.00%) F (61.00%) to (100.00%) Africa (100.00%), which (100.00%) there (100.00%) is (86.00%) a (95.00%) present (89.00%) or (84.00%) rather (97.00%) strong (100.00%) force (97.00%) of (100.00%) British (100.00%), which (100.00%) are (99.00%) at (98.00%) the (100.00%) moment (100.00%), at (91.00%) least (99.00%) successful (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Mr (95.00%). Fox (100.00%), do (99.00%) you (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) must (100.00%) see (100.00%) the (100.00%) eventual (95.00%) feat (79.00%) of (99.00%) Germany (100.00%) before (100.00%) we (100.00%) can (99.00%), uh (81.00%), see (100.00%) any (100.00%) kind (98.00%) of (98.00%) a (84.00%) piece (66.00%) absolutely (57.00%) achieve (41.00%) the (63.00%) world (65.00%)? Well (94.00%) then (93.00%) what (99.00%) course (99.00%) do (99.00%) you (100.00%) recommend (100.00%) that (99.00%) we (100.00%) follow (100.00%) in (100.00%) order (100.00%) to (100.00%) achieve (100.00%) that (100.00%), uh (74.00%), defeat (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 0: Well (93.00%), I (100.00%) say (96.00%) to (78.00%) remain (83.00%), to (99.00%) retain (100.00%) our (99.00%) presence (94.00%) status (100.00%) toward (93.00%) Germany (100.00%) accordingly (84.00%), it (99.00%) is (99.00%) a (91.00%) status (100.00%) of (100.00%) actual (97.00%) non (99.00%) belligerency (93.00%). In (100.00%) other (100.00%) words (100.00%), we (100.00%) are (57.00%) at (99.00%) war (100.00%) morally (99.00%), emotionally (100.00%) and (99.00%) physically (100.00%), but (100.00%) we're (99.00%) not (100.00%) actually (100.00%) fighting (100.00%). And (100.00%) yet (100.00%) I (100.00%) say (100.00%), continue (99.00%) to (100.00%) fight (100.00%) the (98.00%) Japanese (100.00%) in (100.00%) an (99.00%) actual (98.00%) armed (89.00%) way (96.00%). Eventually (100.00%) I (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (98.00%) Japan (100.00%) will (94.00%) be (100.00%) the (99.00%) first (100.00%) to (70.00%) drop (100.00%) out (80.00%) from (84.00%) a (84.00%) matter (100.00%) of (100.00%) interior (38.00%) of (95.00%) internal (100.00%) weakness (100.00%). Then (99.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) turn (100.00%) our (99.00%) attention (100.00%) completely (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) Germans (100.00%) after (100.00%) having (100.00%) eliminated (100.00%) one (98.00%) front (72.00%) completely (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: And (67.00%) do (99.00%) you (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (99.00%) an (71.00%), an (93.00%) expeditionary (86.00%) force (99.00%) sent (94.00%) to (97.00%) the (99.00%) continent (100.00%) of (100.00%) Europe (100.00%) to (96.00%) fight (97.00%) Germany (100.00%) will (100.00%) be (100.00%) necessary (100.00%) 

	Speaker 0: Eventually (100.00%)? 

	Speaker 1: Yes (100.00%), eventually (100.00%), but (32.00%) at (56.00%) the (93.00%) present (43.00%) we (57.00%) must (97.00%) dispose (98.00%) of (99.00%) Japan (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: I (100.00%) believe (99.00%) as (33.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Your (71.00%), 

	Speaker 2: He (94.00%) mentioned (98.00%), we (88.00%) didn't (99.00%) have (99.00%) any (98.00%) common (99.00%) battlefield (100.00%) we're (97.00%) on (99.00%) Iceland (99.00%). We (100.00%) havet (79.00%) occupied (100.00%). We (100.00%) could (77.00%) fly (100.00%) from (100.00%) Iceland (98.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) continent (100.00%) and (100.00%) back (99.00%), and (100.00%) we (100.00%) would (100.00%) have (96.00%) a (99.00%) common (100.00%) battlefield (100.00%) there (83.00%). How (93.00%) about (90.00%) an (85.00%) a (73.00%) F (41.00%) up (96.00%) to (67.00%) 

	Speaker 0: The (97.00%), uh (59.00%), Scandinavian (100.00%) countries (99.00%) you'll (99.00%) have (100.00%) to (100.00%) land (100.00%) at (52.00%) Norway (100.00%), which (99.00%) is (97.00%) the (66.00%) president (99.00%) control (100.00%) of (99.00%) the (99.00%) Russia (30.00%) of (88.00%) the (96.00%), uh (61.00%), German (86.00%). Sweden (99.00%) is (94.00%) not (44.00%), is (80.00%) a (92.00%) neutral (99.00%). And (99.00%) I (100.00%) feel (99.00%) certain (100.00%) were (30.00%) any (54.00%) attempt (97.00%) made (89.00%) to (91.00%) land (100.00%) on (98.00%) Sweden (100.00%). They (98.00%) would (98.00%) call (96.00%) the (94.00%) assistance (98.00%) of (98.00%) Germany (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: What (97.00%) 

	Speaker 3: About (69.00%) south (100.00%) America's (99.00%) position (100.00%) in (99.00%) this (99.00%) too (98.00%)? I (100.00%) think (100.00%) that's (100.00%) a (99.00%) pretty (100.00%) important (100.00%) point (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) haven't (99.00%) brought (100.00%) in (100.00%) as (100.00%) far (100.00%) as (99.00%) the (97.00%), uh (76.00%), concentration (100.00%) of (100.00%), uh (69.00%), German (99.00%) feeling (98.00%) in (100.00%) those (100.00%) countries (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (99.00%), the (99.00%), uh (88.00%), Sanal (52.00%) the (31.00%) small (96.00%) south (100.00%) American (99.00%) countries (100.00%) have (92.00%) put (27.00%) at (41.00%) war (94.00%) and (100.00%) others (100.00%) have (99.00%) said (100.00%) that (98.00%) they (100.00%) will (99.00%) not (100.00%) recognize (99.00%) a (70.00%) state (100.00%) of (99.00%) belligerency (98.00%) between (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%) and (100.00%) Japan (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (97.00%) in (95.00%) the (98.00%) favor (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%), because (100.00%) it (100.00%) means (100.00%) that (96.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) use (100.00%) their (99.00%) Porsche (64.00%) just (100.00%) as (100.00%) we (100.00%) could (99.00%) in (100.00%) time (100.00%) of (39.00%) peace (86.00%). I (99.00%) think (100.00%) they're (99.00%) all (99.00%) definitely (100.00%) sympathetic (100.00%). Of (100.00%) course (100.00%), they (100.00%) have (100.00%) been (100.00%), uh (79.00%), somewhat (99.00%) on (83.00%) the (95.00%) position (100.00%) that (35.00%) Japan (100.00%) has (100.00%) been (100.00%) in (93.00%), namely (84.00%) that (99.00%) they (99.00%) want (100.00%) to (99.00%) be (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) winning (100.00%) side (99.00%) <affirmative> (97.00%), but (100.00%), uh (91.00%), they (100.00%) are (99.00%) so (100.00%) close (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (99.00%) United States (100.00%) that (91.00%) I (100.00%) think (100.00%) that (96.00%) they (100.00%) all (100.00%) realize (94.00%) that (98.00%) their (99.00%) destinies (89.00%) are (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) inevitably (100.00%) wrapped (100.00%) up (100.00%) with (100.00%) those (100.00%) of (98.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%). Uh (86.00%), I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) think (100.00%) that (98.00%) any (100.00%) of (100.00%) us (99.00%) are (100.00%) alarmed (100.00%) over (100.00%) the (99.00%), uh (88.00%), what (99.00%) the (94.00%) south (100.00%) American (99.00%) countries (99.00%) might (99.00%) do (100.00%) in (95.00%) this (89.00%) regard (99.00%) to (88.00%) this (80.00%) war (98.00%). Are (97.00%) we (99.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I (98.00%) don't (95.00%) believe (52.00%), 

	Speaker 2: Well (59.00%), there (96.00%) isn't (99.00%) much (100.00%) that (72.00%) can (100.00%) do (100.00%) they're (95.00%), uh (45.00%), forced (99.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%) whatever (99.00%) they (99.00%) are (98.00%) doing (100.00%). If (99.00%) they (100.00%) did (93.00%) want (93.00%) to (46.00%) do (95.00%) different (99.00%), I (99.00%) think (99.00%) cause (82.00%) of (99.00%) their (99.00%) intimate (99.00%) relationship (100.00%) with (100.00%) the (62.00%) United States (100.00%), it (70.00%) would (99.00%) be (98.00%) cut (99.00%) off (96.00%) completely (100.00%) economically (100.00%) and (98.00%) physically (99.00%), and (51.00%) then (37.00%) every (98.00%) other (100.00%) way (99.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Well (95.00%), I (100.00%) think (100.00%) we're (98.00%) all (99.00%) pretty (99.00%) generally (99.00%) agreed (81.00%) then (98.00%) that (95.00%) the (99.00%) United States (99.00%) must (100.00%) see (81.00%) that (48.00%) the (85.00%) eventually (100.00%) defeat (92.00%) of (99.00%) the (100.00%) act (96.00%) is (25.00%) powers (97.00%) in (98.00%) order (99.00%) to (99.00%) achieve (99.00%) a (44.00%) peace (93.00%) 

	Speaker 0: I (66.00%) believe (88.00%) for (46.00%) right (70.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Mm-hmm (78.00%) <affirmative> (75.00%) I (100.00%) think (100.00%) that's (100.00%) more (100.00%) or (99.00%) less (100.00%), uh (55.00%), universally (100.00%) consented (99.00%) to (99.00%), with (73.00%) this (99.00%), uh (84.00%), discussion (100.00%). Well (95.00%), now (99.00%) after (100.00%) this (100.00%) war (100.00%) is (80.00%) over (100.00%), we're (99.00%) going (99.00%) to (99.00%) have (100.00%) a (100.00%) problem (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (99.00%) even (100.00%) more (100.00%) important (100.00%) and (100.00%) that (100.00%) is (100.00%) this (100.00%) just (100.00%) what (100.00%) part (99.00%) the (98.00%) United States (100.00%), uh (72.00%), can (100.00%) and (100.00%) will (76.00%) play (100.00%) in (99.00%) the (100.00%) formation (99.00%) of (100.00%) some (100.00%) kind (100.00%) of (94.00%) a (82.00%) post-war (98.00%) world (93.00%). Mr (93.00%). Fox (100.00%). Well (68.00%), 

	Speaker 0: Thereby (52.00%) hangs (97.00%), I (99.00%) believe (100.00%) the (100.00%) entire (100.00%) problem (100.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) personally (100.00%) that (99.00%) if (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%) will (97.00%) take (100.00%) part (98.00%) in (96.00%) the (99.00%) peace (99.00%) treaty (42.00%) and (86.00%) we (99.00%) will (98.00%), we (100.00%) shouldn't (100.00%) make (100.00%) the (100.00%) mistakes (100.00%) that (93.00%) we (99.00%) made (99.00%) back (99.00%) at (91.00%) for (50.00%) SI (34.00%) in (97.00%) 1917, 18 (95.00%), and (98.00%) which (99.00%) caused (99.00%) us (99.00%) to (100.00%) remain (100.00%) at (98.00%) war (100.00%) officially (100.00%) with (95.00%) Germany (100.00%), till (40.00%) the (97.00%) twenties (99.00%). If (100.00%) we (100.00%) are (99.00%) going (100.00%) to (100.00%) set (98.00%) up (98.00%) an (99.00%) international (100.00%), uh (72.00%), association (100.00%) of (100.00%) nations (100.00%), then (98.00%) we (100.00%) must (100.00%) be (100.00%) in (100.00%) it (100.00%), right (65.00%)? We (99.00%) must (100.00%) give (100.00%) that (100.00%) association (100.00%) some (100.00%) form (100.00%) of (100.00%) teeth (79.00%) so (100.00%) that (98.00%) it (99.00%) will (98.00%) work (100.00%). Certainly (100.00%) if (100.00%) Germany (100.00%) is (98.00%) beaten (100.00%), we (100.00%) cannot (98.00%) kick (99.00%) her (61.00%) when (99.00%) it's (100.00%) down (100.00%), because (99.00%) this (59.00%) same (100.00%) situation (100.00%) will (99.00%) occur (100.00%). At (100.00%) the (100.00%) end (100.00%) of (100.00%) 20 (100.00%) years (100.00%), it (83.00%) has (99.00%) occurred (100.00%). Now (100.00%) a (100.00%) great (100.00%) deal (100.00%). I (100.00%) feel (100.00%) of (97.00%) the (86.00%) blame (100.00%) for (97.00%) this (100.00%) war (100.00%) must (100.00%) be (100.00%) laid (57.00%) at (99.00%) the (100.00%) doors (100.00%) of (100.00%) those (100.00%) nations (100.00%), which (100.00%) were (99.00%) victorious (100.00%) in (98.00%) the (100.00%) last (100.00%) world (100.00%) war (100.00%). And (92.00%) then (92.00%) 

	Speaker 3: We (93.00%) want (49.00%) force (57.00%) is (52.00%) our (99.00%) leading (100.00%) policy (99.00%). So (99.00%) far (100.00%) as (99.00%) we're (99.00%) concerned (100.00%), 

	Speaker 0: I (56.00%) said (68.00%) that (54.00%) we (99.00%) cannot (91.00%) kick (99.00%) Germany (99.00%) down (100.00%) and (98.00%) keep (100.00%) her (86.00%) down (99.00%). There's (98.00%) always (100.00%) a (99.00%) possibility (100.00%) that (99.00%) we (100.00%) can (99.00%) keep (100.00%) her (89.00%) down (100.00%). As (99.00%) we (99.00%) did (99.00%) not (100.00%) do (99.00%) that (69.00%) after (65.00%) the (93.00%) last (99.00%) world (99.00%) war (99.00%), we (100.00%) kicked (100.00%) her (97.00%) down (96.00%), but (82.00%) we (98.00%) let (96.00%) her (81.00%) get (97.00%) back (100.00%) up (99.00%). Then (98.00%) may (92.00%) I (99.00%) ask (99.00%) one (100.00%) question (100.00%) to (98.00%) those (100.00%) people (100.00%) who (99.00%) are (98.00%) here (100.00%)? Do (100.00%) you (100.00%) believe (100.00%) it's (100.00%) Christian (100.00%)? Or (100.00%) do (100.00%) you (100.00%) believe (100.00%) it's (100.00%) even (100.00%) decent (100.00%) or (100.00%) democratic (100.00%) to (99.00%) carry (100.00%) on (99.00%) that (99.00%) sort (99.00%) of (98.00%) a (94.00%) policy (99.00%) toward (61.00%) of (44.00%) a (54.00%) ordination (61.00%)? I (91.00%) don't (77.00%) think (96.00%) so (86.00%). I (96.00%) don't (99.00%) think (98.00%) it's (91.00%) good (96.00%) sense (93.00%). It (99.00%) doesn't (100.00%) seem (100.00%) practical (100.00%). 

	Speaker 3: I (99.00%) think (100.00%) our (99.00%) fights (99.00%) with (77.00%) the (86.00%) German (100.00%) government (100.00%), not (100.00%) with (99.00%) the (96.00%) German (100.00%) people (100.00%), 

	Speaker 2: I (100.00%) agree (99.00%) all (93.00%) that (95.00%). Uh (53.00%), but (89.00%) there (94.00%) wouldn't (96.00%) be (98.00%) any (98.00%) German (99.00%) government (100.00%). If (94.00%) the (83.00%) German (99.00%) people (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) sanction (100.00%) that (80.00%) Hitler (100.00%) can't (100.00%) fight (96.00%) the (82.00%) war (100.00%) by (89.00%) himself (99.00%), he (99.00%) can't (100.00%) form (100.00%) all (100.00%) the (99.00%) public (100.00%) opinions (100.00%). Someone (98.00%) has (51.00%) put (54.00%) him (75.00%) there (99.00%). Just (99.00%) the (99.00%) same (100.00%). As (99.00%) all (100.00%) leaders (99.00%) are (99.00%) put (99.00%) there (97.00%), they (100.00%) have (99.00%) to (100.00%) have (99.00%) a (64.00%) backing (99.00%), someone (99.00%) behind (100.00%) him (43.00%). They (93.00%) can't (91.00%) go (86.00%) out (77.00%) their (51.00%) bare (92.00%) fist (60.00%) and (99.00%) say (98.00%), come (95.00%) on (95.00%), boys (94.00%), all (86.00%) of (76.00%) you (91.00%) follow (100.00%) me (96.00%). 

	Speaker 3: Well (99.00%) then (99.00%) again (99.00%), you (95.00%) gotta (77.00%) look (99.00%) at (96.00%), at (93.00%) the (99.00%) Germany (99.00%), which (100.00%) resulted (100.00%) from (100.00%) what (100.00%) we (100.00%) did (100.00%) and (99.00%) what (100.00%) we (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) carry (99.00%) out (99.00%) because (100.00%) Hitler (100.00%) himself (100.00%) is (93.00%) a (99.00%) product (100.00%) of (99.00%), we (100.00%) might (100.00%) say (99.00%) of (99.00%) what (100.00%) we (99.00%), as (99.00%) an (99.00%) entire (100.00%) group (100.00%) of (100.00%) nations (100.00%) did (82.00%), then (98.00%) German (98.00%) people (99.00%) when (85.00%) you're (87.00%) ready (62.00%) for (89.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Something (80.00%) there (73.00%), but (75.00%) you (64.00%) certainly (68.00%) 

	Speaker 3: Naturally (76.00%) they're (72.00%) going (69.00%) vote (59.00%) in (55.00%) 

	Speaker 2: Hitler (99.00%), out (93.00%) on (97.00%) a (90.00%) little (96.00%) space (93.00%) of (96.00%) its (85.00%) own (99.00%) and (83.00%) say (92.00%), he's (95.00%) the (57.00%) cause (89.00%) of (66.00%) all (64.00%) this (62.00%) that (57.00%) 

	Speaker 3: Well (77.00%), nobody (51.00%) is (78.00%) that (53.00%). No (83.00%), 

	Speaker 0: You (97.00%) can't (94.00%). You (88.00%) can't (99.00%) hope (97.00%) when (99.00%) I (100.00%) say (99.00%) to (98.00%) care (22.00%) to (90.00%) kick (97.00%) Germany (85.00%) and (99.00%) keep (100.00%) her (98.00%) down (100.00%), what (100.00%) will (90.00%) you (98.00%) do (99.00%)? I (95.00%) mean (96.00%), you (99.00%) can't (100.00%) wipe (97.00%) out (88.00%) an (84.00%) entire (94.00%) people (100.00%), even (100.00%) Hitler's (100.00%) trial (65.00%) that (26.00%) found (98.00%) it (49.00%) extremely (100.00%) unsuccessful (100.00%). So (100.00%) I (99.00%) think (100.00%) that (99.00%) a (97.00%) just (89.00%) and (99.00%) beneficial (100.00%) piece (99.00%) must (100.00%) come (100.00%) out (74.00%) of (82.00%) this (99.00%). And (99.00%) furthermore (100.00%), I (99.00%) believe (100.00%) this (99.00%) piece (46.00%) must (100.00%) be (100.00%) based (97.00%) thought (75.00%) of (81.00%) this (69.00%) armament (73.00%) policy (99.00%). Well (83.00%), do (42.00%) you (99.00%) don't (100.00%) think (99.00%) then (97.00%) that (93.00%) it (99.00%) will (94.00%) be (100.00%) wise (100.00%) no (59.00%) necessary (100.00%) for (100.00%) the (100.00%) United States (100.00%) to (100.00%) police (100.00%) the (100.00%) world (100.00%) so (100.00%) to (99.00%) speak (100.00%) after (100.00%) this (100.00%) war's (100.00%) over (100.00%)? Why (98.00%)? No (89.00%), I (100.00%) think (100.00%) that's (100.00%) going (100.00%) back (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) dark (100.00%) ages (99.00%). 

	Speaker 3: Mike (95.00%), I (99.00%) disagree (100.00%) with (99.00%) you (98.00%). I (98.00%) thought (98.00%) you (99.00%) were (100.00%) getting (100.00%) it (79.00%). Another (100.00%) point (100.00%) when (99.00%) I (100.00%) said (100.00%) force (80.00%), I (100.00%) meant (100.00%) that (100.00%) as (99.00%) an (99.00%) immediate (100.00%) step (99.00%) towards (100.00%) reconstruction (99.00%), you (100.00%) would've (97.00%) necessity (96.00%). He (98.00%) had (94.00%) have (97.00%) to (98.00%) use (97.00%) force (98.00%). Otherwise (100.00%) you'd (100.00%) have (99.00%) the (99.00%) same (100.00%) thing (99.00%) reoccurring (100.00%). And (100.00%) that's (100.00%) what (100.00%) we (100.00%) didn't (100.00%) do (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: If (100.00%) you (99.00%) have (99.00%) an (97.00%) international (99.00%) police (100.00%) force (100.00%), which (100.00%) apparently (100.00%) the (95.00%) United States (95.00%) is (99.00%) going (98.00%) to (97.00%) supply (98.00%), then (97.00%) you're (98.00%) simply (99.00%) going (98.00%) to (96.00%) leave (96.00%) the (94.00%) world (88.00%) one (76.00%) way (76.00%).
