Speaker 0    00:00:00    Yeah, I've been thinking about it for a while. Um, you know, part of it is like, uh, like I have a bunch of houses, but I don't spend a lot of time in most of 'em and, um, that doesn't seem like a good use of assets. Like somebody could probably be enjoying those houses get better use of than me. So don't  
Speaker 1    00:00:23    You have gene Wilder's house? I do. That's amazing. That's awesome.  
Speaker 0    00:00:26    Wow. That's it's exactly what you'd expect.  
Speaker 1    00:00:30    Did you request that the buyer not fuck it up?  
Speaker 0    00:00:32    Yeah, that's a requirement.  
Speaker 1    00:00:33    Oh, a requirement. That's a good requirement. Yeah. In that, in that case, in that house. Yeah.  
Speaker 0    00:00:38    It'll probably self last, but still, I don't care.  
Speaker 1    00:00:40    He's a legend. He would want his soul. He'd want his essence. Yeah. In the building.  
Speaker 0    00:00:46    It's and it's there. It's a real quirk. Is it quirky house? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:00:50    What, what makes you say it's there? Like what do you get out of it?  
Speaker 0    00:00:54    Um, I mean, all the, all the cabinets are like hand handmade and they're like, oh, odd shapes. And there's like doors to nowhere and strange like car and tunnels and really odd, odd paintings on the wall. And, um, yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:14    Did you ever live in it?  
Speaker 0    00:01:15    It's very quirky. <laugh> I did live in it briefly. Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:01:19    But why do you buy houses? Like if you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go? I think I'd like to have that.  
Speaker 0    00:01:26    Well, I, you know, had one house and then the junior Wilder house right across the road from me, from, from my main house and it was gonna get, it was gonna get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years. And, and I was like, whoa, I think I'll, I'll buy it and preserve the spur of gene water and not have a giant construction zone. And then the, you know, this, I started having like some privacy issues where like, people would like less people just like come to my house and, you know, start climbing over the walls and stuff. <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:02:07    I'm like, man. Um, so then I started like bought a house, some of the houses around my house, and then I thought at one point, well, you know, it'd be cool to, to build a house. So then I, I acquired some properties at the top of Samara road, uh, and which has got a great view. And it's like, okay, well these, some bunch of sort of small, older houses, they're gonna get torn down. Anyway. I was like, well, you know, if I collect these like little, little houses, then I can build something, you know, I don't know, artistic, like a, you know, dream house type of thing.  
Speaker 1    00:02:46    What's a dream house for Elon Musk. Like some Tony stark type shit.  
Speaker 0    00:02:49    Yeah, definitely. <laugh> Yeah. You gotta have the, the dome that opens up with the, the steal helicopter and that kind of thing, you know? Yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:02:57    For sure. Fuck. Yeah, yeah,  
Speaker 0    00:02:59    Fuck. Yeah. Um, but, but then it was like, man, do want, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I'd be real, you know, get like OCD on the little details and the design and, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter <laugh> so, you know, like what's more important Mars or a house. I like Mars. Okay. <laugh>  
Speaker 1    00:03:26    Is that really how you think like that it'd be better off planning on a trip to Mars or getting people to Mars?  
Speaker 0    00:03:34    Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, the, you can only do so many things. Right, right. So how you can, well,  
Speaker 1    00:03:40    I don't know how you do what you do anyway. I don't, I don't understand how you can run Bo the boring company, Tesla, SpaceX, all these different things you're doing constantly. I just, I don't understand. I mean, you explained last time you were here, how you sort of allocate your time and, and, and how hectic it is and insane. I still don't. The, the product is, uh, baffling. Just doesn't make sense how you can get so much done.  
Speaker 0    00:04:05    Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that, there's still some opportunity cost of time and allocating time to building a house. Even if it was a really great house, still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary, to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy. Uh, SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, by the, the most amount of like brain cycles. Um, you know, boring company does not take, you know, like less than 1% of rain cycles. And, um, and then this Neurolink, which is, I don't, maybe it's like 5% and then 5%  
Speaker 1    00:04:50    That's that's a good chunk.  
Speaker 0    00:04:51    It's a good chunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Speaker 1    00:04:52    We were talking about that last time. And you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live when it's actually going to be available like 10 testing on people right now.  
Speaker 0    00:05:03    No, we're not testing on people yet, but I, I think it won't be too long. I think we may be able to implant in your link in less than a year in a person, I think.  
Speaker 1    00:05:19    And when you do this, is there any ask that you have to do before you do something like this to, to see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things? Is it, is it, is there a potential for rejection?  
Speaker 0    00:05:33    It's, it's a very low potential for rejection.
