Speaker 0    00:00:01    Test test, test, test, test. Okay. Gonna have a little bit of trouble with this, but today's date is September 8th, 2011. This is pat Asper interviewing Andrew laws at the offices of the international longshoreman in Houston, Texas on clear lake city Boulevard. Now am I, am I right about Houston Webster? We're in Webster. You know, I was wondering about that. Okay. That's that's fine. We're still Houston ship channel. And um, I think the thing now I'm gonna mess around a little bit it just to make sure I've got some good levels. Would you just say, uh, maybe your name and your address?  
Speaker 1    00:00:52    Andrew Lee laws senior. My home address. 35 20 avenue, one half Galveston, Texas.  
Speaker 0    00:01:07    I'm gonna push that a little bit closer if you don't mind. You're you can relax. Go right ahead. If I get it closer, then you'll be good. Okay. Um, well, let's start out with just some real basics. Could you tell me a little bit about when and where you were born in your early life and a little bit about your family?  
Speaker 1    00:01:26    I was born in I a go Texas I a G O Texas, and the year 1927, August 29th. So the parent Henry and I Lou eyes and laws, the seventh of nine children, I went to school in new Gulf, Texas finished June, 1946. Went to Galveston in Texas seeking work to earn money, go to college, fortunate enough that a job on the waterfront where I've been ever since that was my college education.  
Speaker 0    00:02:27    Tell me about that for a stay  
Speaker 1    00:02:32    First day was kind of hard and unordinary to an extent cause I was raised on the farm. Never knew anything about the ship, surprised to be able to see all that steel floating on the water from there, I started hard labor. I liked it. I liked the Wes and I became interested in being in longshore. At that point,  
Speaker 0    00:03:12    You said you liked the hard labor. Tell me about what kind of hard labor you did in those first few years.  
Speaker 1    00:03:19    Well, I, I threw bags of row sugar, discharged from ship weigh 350 pounds each we had to SL it, it rope it and send it out to ship. I'd trim, grain book, grain on the ship of shovels. I threw bags of rice, corn flour, some hundred pounds, some hundred 40 pounds. And the largest was 275 pounds. I worked bag or small bags, 75 pounds or more. I rode cotton in the ship. Bigger of cutting, right from 550 to 575 pounds bales.  
Speaker 0    00:04:33    Now, uh, when you say I, I throw, I would throw bags. Uh, what are you talking about? Are you, can you describe a little bit that kind of the work?  
Speaker 1    00:04:43    Well, I would throw some people used the word pitch, some used throw, but you would have a partner and you'd pick up and throw 'em and you would throw 'em and you would floor, maybe come start in the bottom of the ship, you'd come six high in the wings. And then, and you get in the hatch where you'd flow off till you get the level that, and you keep going at that pace until you get to the top of the ship, then you would have to, you get to the top of the ship. You would have to what they call crown out. You would have to go six and eight high, bring it up to the top.  
Speaker 0    00:05:21    And you would have a partner doing this. Now. Were there more than two of you all doing kind work?  
Speaker 1    00:05:26    Yes, that would be at that time, there were eight men in the hole. There were fold each side. When I say side, when you line the ship up to go toward the end, you'd call that the fire end and on the back, what the steering was, you'd call it after end. The lift side of the ship going forward would be the PO side. The right side would be the stop side and each S where you would work, there would be four on the pool side, pull on the stop side. You'd get one load over here. I'd get one load over there with that four. And you just kept working in that fashion.  
Speaker 0    00:06:11    And that was eight men. Uh, is there a word to describe that team of eight?  
Speaker 1    00:06:16    You record it a gang. <affirmative> he called it again? See that that would be four men on each side.
