Speaker 0    00:00:02    All right, this is Betsy Peterson and, and it is September 7th or eighth. <laugh>. Okay. It's September 8th, 2011. I'm at the offices of the ILA in, um, clear lake and am getting ready to do an interview with Charlie Lou Pacey. That's right. And Charlie, Lou, could I ask you to just say something? Introduce yourself.  
Speaker 1    00:00:34    Okay. My name is Charlie Lou Pacey. Uh, my maiden name was Moses and my mother was Emily Moses, and it's a shame that she wasn't here to be the one being interviewed because she really knew it all. <laugh>  
Speaker 0    00:00:52    Well, so actually I think our, our sound levels are good. So we'll just keep on going then if that's right. Sure. Um,  
Speaker 1    00:01:00    Here's my I card by the way.  
Speaker 0    00:01:02    Okay, wonderful. Good, good. My contact. Okay. I didn't know information. What is the, what's the, where does Pacey come from? What's the background of that?  
Speaker 1    00:01:12    Um, my it's French. French.  
Speaker 0    00:01:15    Okay. Uh,  
Speaker 1    00:01:16    It's uh, this is my understanding from my husband and my mother-in-law that, uh, it was PI say in France and, and, uh, my husband's family came over, I think to Louisiana. And there was like maybe seven boys and, uh, six of 'em. They, when they came to tech, Galveston, they changed it to PII. And, uh, my husband's father changed to Pacey, so there's very few Pacey and more Pisces  
Speaker 0    00:01:47    <laugh>. Okay. Now. And so you were born here in Houston?  
Speaker 1    00:01:52    I, no, I actually was born in Galveston.  
Speaker 0    00:01:55    Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:01:55    Okay. The district office used to be in Galveston. It was in Galveston until after the hurricane, hurricane I, uh, in September of 2008. So up until that time, the district office was in Galveston.  
Speaker 0    00:02:10    Oh.  
Speaker 1    00:02:11    So all the years I worked up until then was in Galveston, not  
Speaker 0    00:02:15    Houston. Okay. So, so  
Speaker 1    00:02:17    I'm not sure if this is the interview you want.  
Speaker 0    00:02:18    No, no, no, that's fine. That's fine. So you still commute from Galveston?  
Speaker 1    00:02:23    I live in bio Vista. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:02:25    So,  
Speaker 1    00:02:25    Okay. Uh, I commute, I've been commuting since the hurricane.  
Speaker 0    00:02:29    Oh, okay.  
Speaker 1    00:02:31    We had temporary offices after the hurricane on Fuqua, uh, in the same building as our pension and welfare office. And we were there a couple of years until we built this building here. It's actually we is the  
Speaker 0    00:02:45    City. Oh, okay. Okay.  
Speaker 1    00:02:47    Uh, clear lake city Boulevard, but  
Speaker 0    00:02:49    Midwest. Okay. Okay. And, uh, and what happened to the ILA offices in the hurricane? Well,  
Speaker 1    00:02:55    It was severely damaged and, uh, they just, uh, the officers at the time decided that, uh, they didn't want to go through that again. And instead of renovating and, uh, rebuilding there, that they would move out of the way and come up here. And since most of the men, a lot of the men, or could be closer to the Houston locals, which have a lot more men than the Galveston  
Speaker 0    00:03:23    Locals.  
Speaker 1    00:03:24    So little bit easier for people to get to flying in and out of hobbying Intercontinental. And, and most of them live up here, so. Okay. But it had been there forever. <laugh> in Galveston.  
Speaker 0    00:03:38    Oh, I had had no idea. Okay. Okay. Well, let, let's go back a little bit. Um, so you were born in Galveston and you were saying earlier  
Speaker 1    00:03:48    In  
Speaker 0    00:03:49    19 43, 19 43, 68  
Speaker 1    00:03:51    Years old now. Okay.  
Speaker 0    00:03:53    So, oh, so you were born during the war? Yes. Yeah. Um, and you said that you, your mother was in the ILA or you were practically born in the ILA. So tell me about that  
Speaker 1    00:04:04    Mother. Uh, my mother's was Emily Moses, and she was a one person office. She, um, she worked for the president at the time was Frank yer. And I can tell you stories about that. And then after Frank jugar left, uh, Ralph Massey, who was a secretary treasurer at the time Frank Jager left, he became the president. And then, uh, she worked for buddy raspberry, J raspberry. And that's when I officially started working for the, I for was for buddy raspberry when he was a secretary treasurer. Well, actually Mr. Massey was still alive and still the president when I first started working, that was in November, 1977. And then I worked for, uh, Benny Holland and then that ly Fitzgerald. So, but my mother was the, uh, was there for 44 years.  
Speaker 0    00:05:09    And when did she start?  
Speaker 1    00:05:11    Well, I was trying to figure it out because, uh, I had, uh, I looked up her obituary. She died in 2000 in September 15th, 2000. And, uh, at the time I.
