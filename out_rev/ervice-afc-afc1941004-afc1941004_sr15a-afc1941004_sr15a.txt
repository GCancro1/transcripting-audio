Speaker 1    00:00:07    Mr. Rossick what do you think about Japan's action last Sunday?  
Speaker 2    00:00:11    I think they were all wrong.  
Speaker 1    00:00:14    Well, for what reason do you think there was any justification? Whatever on the part of Japan for making out attack?  
Speaker 2    00:00:20    I don't think there was any,  
Speaker 1    00:00:23    What do you think the United States should have done? They in  
Speaker 2    00:00:26    To declare war on?  
Speaker 1    00:00:28    You were, in other words, you were behind Roosevelt's resolution,  
Speaker 2    00:00:32    Huh? Hundred percent.  
Speaker 1    00:00:34    Well, that's good. Do you think that all America has fallen? I mean, all of your associates have fallen in pretty well behind  
Speaker 2    00:00:41    Far as I can see all of them.  
Speaker 1    00:00:44    Do you hear much talk around them, your job on you're a carpenter aren't  
Speaker 2    00:00:48    You? Yes.  
Speaker 1    00:00:49    Finisher.  
Speaker 2    00:00:51    They, uh, right. Smart talk.  
Speaker 1    00:00:53    What seems to be the general opinion amongst the carpenter's union man?  
Speaker 2    00:00:59    Well, they all battle like me. They think it's right for United States and declare war.  
Speaker 1    00:01:06    They seem to have any opinion as to who's gonna win or who's gonna lose.  
Speaker 2    00:01:11    Well, uh, some of 'em seems to think that they're going last on, but I'm of a different opinion. I think it's gonna last quite a while.  
Speaker 1    00:01:19    How come?  
Speaker 2    00:01:20    Well, because United States is gonna first have to corner him.  
Speaker 1    00:01:25    <laugh>  
Speaker 2    00:01:28    Just like a dog catching a rabbit. You've got catch him before you can kill him.  
Speaker 1    00:01:31    That's right. It's gonna be some problem. Catch him out there in the Pacific  
Speaker 2    00:01:35    Ocean. That's right. That's  
Speaker 1    00:01:36    Right. Do you think maybe Germany had any hand in this?  
Speaker 2    00:01:41    I believe Hitler had direct contact in that  
Speaker 1    00:01:45    He's one that instigate.  
Speaker 2    00:01:48    I believe that. Right.  
Speaker 1    00:01:49    What do you think about Russia's partying?  
Speaker 2    00:01:53    Well, I don't think Russia's got anything to do with it.  
Speaker 1    00:01:56    I mean, though, do you think Russia's gonna give us a hand? Do you think she's gonna support us or is she going to,  
Speaker 2    00:02:02    Well, to be honest with you, I, uh, wouldn't trust them too far.  
Speaker 1    00:02:08    You wouldn't trust Russia?  
Speaker 2    00:02:09    Not, not too far.  
Speaker 1    00:02:11    Well, why do you reckon Japan wanted to do such cool things attack the United States?  
Speaker 2    00:02:18    Well, just Listening it Hitler, that's my opinion.  
Speaker 1    00:02:24    And in other words, it wasn't their own, wasn't their own deciding know,  
Speaker 2    00:02:29    Not totally.  
Speaker 1    00:02:32    I don't believe, uh, what you think about Japan preparation. Do you think I'd like to kinda summarize that by that? I mean, why, how is Japan Japan prepared for more? You?  
Speaker 2    00:02:46    I don't think the prepared to, they might think they are, but I don't think they last over two years.  
Speaker 1    00:02:53    You mean a collapse in  
Speaker 2    00:02:55    Economically? I believe. Well.  
Speaker 1    00:02:57    Well, what about the United States though? How well prepared is she?  
Speaker 2    00:03:01    Well, I believe she's as well prepared as Japan and, uh, she can prepare faster now than Japan. Can.  
Speaker 1    00:03:08    What do you think the labor ought to do about this? You know, labor has been in the opinion of some people getting kind of a wrong deal and fixing get a pretty raw deal, at least just before a while. Was there?  
Speaker 2    00:03:22    Well, uh, that's my opinion. I think they didn't, I don't believe in strikes during this, uh,  
Speaker 1    00:03:30    Emergency  
Speaker 2    00:03:31    This emergency, but at the same time, I don't believe in the capitalist trumping on the labor man.  
Speaker 1    00:03:39    Well, I like that. I like that. Like that opinion on that. And I think that, uh, do you think labor's gonna come out though ahead after this war? Do you think that, uh, in other words, her rights will be protect protected labor man, black to be protected  
Speaker 2    00:03:55    Properly? I believe so will.  
Speaker 1    00:03:58    Well, how about Roosevelt? Is he a friend or not labor?  
Speaker 2    00:04:02    He's a laboring man's friend, at least. That's the way I take him.  
Speaker 1    00:04:07    What about Mr. O Daniel Senator, Texas. You Tom con?  
Speaker 2    00:04:11    Well, I don't think very much if you, you Senator O Daniels.  
Speaker 1    00:04:16    He's the one that, uh, gotten bad. The labor here in Texas sometimes ago.  
Speaker 2    00:04:22    Well, I think very little of him and I'd rather not even discuss him.  
Speaker 1    00:04:26    <laugh>  
Speaker 2    00:04:27    That's right.  
Speaker 1    00:04:28    Well, that's good. Uh, a minute ago you said you thought that, uh, all your fellow workers out there on job. Where about you working,  
Speaker 2    00:04:38    Working on the music hall, the university of, of Texas.  
Speaker 1    00:04:42    They're all in behind the road. Have you heard anybody just saying, have you heard any, anybody that's not with the United States is  
Speaker 2    00:04:48    Haven't heard of soul. Another one  
Speaker 1    00:04:51    In other words, labor got right in behind. We need,  
Speaker 2    00:04:55    I believe the labor is a hundred percent behind  
Speaker 1    00:04:58    You're in Austin. Well, that's interesting. Cause goodness know he need their sport. Everybody needed, uh, labor sport. I mean this country go on. But how about the south Americas? What do you think they're gonna do? What south America countries  
Speaker 2    00:05:20    Well tell about, I don't know much about this.  
Speaker 1    00:05:27    You think you're gonna be a hell?  
Speaker 2    00:05:29    Well, yes, there'll be some help. No doubt about that.  
Speaker 1    00:05:33    Be a, he won't get under our feet now while we're trying to catch catch Japanese. How about the Japan prepar? You think they pretty well prepared?  
Speaker 2    00:05:44    I believe they prepared the last two years.  
Speaker 1    00:05:47    I mean, you think they've been preparing for this very thing?  
Speaker 2    00:05:50    Oh yes. All this scrap on, they bought United States. That's that's all it went in with war machinery. Mm-hmm  
Speaker 1    00:05:58    <affirmative> you reckon people that sold them, that scrap iron knew about it. What do you, what do you think the laboring man thinks about that?  
Speaker 2    00:06:05    Well, I guess the laboring man was the same opinion around. Sure. They see it was a capitalist that, uh, sold this stuff to him. They knew what they was using it for, But that wasn't a question at that time. It was if money greed for money  
Speaker 1    00:06:21    Mm-hmm <affirmative> yes. You, uh, what about the oil that was sent to me? You any opinion?  
Speaker 2    00:06:27    Well, I believe they knew that this store in that way, for the very purpose  
Speaker 1    00:06:32    Flagships back over the United States by us,  
Speaker 2    00:06:34    That's it.  
Speaker 1    00:06:37    I wouldn't be surprised about. That's not very sound opinion, Mr.  
Speaker 2    00:06:40    That's exactly what I.
