Hi. (99.56%) I'm (96.58%) Pam. (25.39%) I (99.37%) run (98.14%) a (99.02%) group (99.51%) called (85.60%) the (82.86%) eighteenth. (98.14%) We (98.49%) are (98.34%) basically (99.17%) animation (99.27%) technology (99.85%) and (99.66%) research (99.66%) teams. (74.51%) So (97.75%) I'm (90.67%) helping (79.98%) Phil (88.13%) Avoid, (30.00%) which (99.61%) I (99.71%) think (98.39%) hasn't (95.70%) been (98.78%) properly (99.71%) addressed (99.76%) in (99.56%) our (99.22%) organization, (99.22%) which (97.51%) is (96.39%) he (38.53%) is (90.72%) responsible (99.56%) for (99.46%) doing (99.90%) research (99.95%) and (96.88%) learning (99.90%) far (92.63%) into (99.07%) the (99.66%) future. (99.85%) We (98.39%) have (96.88%) frostbite (60.89%) technology (99.66%) across (77.10%) by (58.94%) animation (97.22%) which (99.71%) does (70.12%) a (96.48%) lot (98.05%) of (93.90%) technology (99.76%) for (98.24%) the (99.02%) current (99.76%) but (96.44%) doesn't (99.66%) do (98.19%) so (99.32%) much (99.12%) thinking (95.46%) doesn't (95.36%) do (98.58%) enough (99.85%) innovation (98.49%) that (86.43%) I (99.80%) believe (99.56%) they (99.37%) should. (98.83%) And (99.07%) I (98.58%) am (98.88%) trying (99.80%) to (99.71%) help (99.51%) fill (91.46%) that (94.34%) void (81.98%) by (98.97%) creating (99.76%) technology (97.61%) for (82.03%) now, (99.02%) but (99.80%) also (99.71%) for (99.56%) one (99.66%) to (99.12%) two (99.76%) years (97.41%) out. (55.62%) So (97.80%) thinking (99.90%) about (99.02%) things (99.90%) that (99.37%) we (99.61%) can (99.71%) do (99.27%) to (99.17%) improve (99.56%) the (99.56%) quality (99.90%) of (99.71%) animation (99.41%) in (88.13%) our (98.97%) game (77.34%) specifically (99.66%) gameplay (62.60%) animation (98.88%) So (99.27%) this (99.22%) is (99.02%) how (99.41%) do (99.85%) I (99.85%) make (99.32%) the (99.17%) player (88.04%) look (98.34%) and (99.85%) feel (99.85%) realistic (99.51%) believable, (98.68%) responsive__?__ (99.76%) How (99.12%) do (96.83%) I (99.90%) do (99.80%) that (99.61%) in (99.27%) a (97.02%) way (99.17%) that (99.37%) doesn't (99.56%) make (99.12%) the (98.49%) workflow (98.14%) really (98.68%) problematic (100.00%) for (97.12%) the (95.70%) artists__?__ (60.79%) How (99.85%) do (99.90%) I (98.14%) do (99.17%) this (99.90%) in (99.17%) a (95.36%) way (96.48%) that (99.56%) is (72.02%) really (99.76%) easy (99.85%) to (99.17%) do, (99.46%) but (97.56%) it (79.83%) creates (92.58%) powerful (98.58%) techniques (51.27%) that (94.53%) also (98.83%) scales (99.71%) across (99.95%) a (99.27%) bunch (100.00%) of (99.61%) different (99.95%) games. (93.55%) So (99.17%) we (44.87%) games (81.45%) like (98.19%) Fifa, (83.01%) you (58.15%) know, (93.70%) they're (54.83%) very (97.56%) animation (99.37%) driven (96.39%) games. (74.27%) They're (73.00%) they (38.62%) need (97.12%) to (99.46%) have (99.66%) a (99.56%) certain (99.71%) style (92.14%) movement (88.92%) with (81.84%) games (92.48%) like (99.32%) like, (98.88%) battlefield, (99.37%) which (98.49%) is (88.92%) much (92.72%) our (29.35%) multi (73.63%) multiplayer (66.65%) focused (65.77%) very (98.10%) very (97.90%) server (99.37%) driven (99.85%) animation (99.51%) system, (92.43%) so (99.41%) it (98.68%) needs (97.66%) to (99.22%) be (99.12%) kind (61.52%) of... (61.38%) You (97.51%) need (98.97%) to (99.76%) handle (99.12%) a (96.88%) very (99.56%) wide (99.66%) variety (99.95%) of (98.44%) animation (98.68%) systems. (85.06%) Then (98.10%) we (99.37%) also (99.56%) have (98.44%) games (98.88%) like (99.80%) dragon (98.73%) age (34.59%) and (97.71%) and (83.98%) Anthem, (99.22%) which (86.91%) have (93.55%) crazy (99.76%) creatures, (99.37%) multi (62.55%) things (99.07%) with (95.21%) like, (93.31%) chairs (99.71%) that (99.41%) come (98.63%) to (88.96%) like, (54.05%) like, (99.12%) all (76.42%) sorts (99.71%) of (68.26%) very (99.41%) interesting (99.41%) creative (75.59%) races (46.68%) like (92.97%) how (99.85%) can (99.46%) I (99.80%) create (99.95%) systems (97.80%) to (54.30%) help (80.86%) animation (48.73%) and (57.32%) all (97.95%) these (99.37%) varieties (62.94%) of (96.88%) games (97.27%) do (98.83%) better__?__ (99.80%) So (98.93%) that (53.37%) that's (92.92%) my...

(99.95%) By (75.44%) improving (99.80%) quality (99.90%) through (99.37%) technology. (99.51%) And (96.00%) I (98.44%) have (98.54%) a (93.16%) team (96.88%) three (97.80%) people (99.56%) two (59.62%) two (91.06%) engineers (99.90%) and (84.57%) one (99.27%) technical (95.80%) animator (86.67%) who (99.22%) are (37.89%) really (99.22%) engaged (99.66%) help (98.29%) me (98.58%) do (99.56%) that.

(99.71%) Well, (98.83%) it's (98.73%) not (99.71%) easy. (99.90%) It's (91.02%) it's (99.37%) hard (99.95%) to (99.51%) say (99.71%) no. (96.97%) But (94.14%) the (94.38%) the (98.73%) id (70.95%) idea (79.49%) is... (99.51%) I (99.51%) don't (99.41%) write (97.90%) the (99.17%) feature (99.37%) for (97.31%) you (87.35%) game. (47.80%) I (77.78%) write (64.40%) the (85.25%) technology (99.90%) that (98.10%) helps (97.27%) you (98.14%) right (61.47%) the (99.46%) feature.

(91.26%) For (27.32%) what (98.44%) do (99.71%) I (99.66%) need (99.80%) to (98.93%) do__?__ (99.80%) What's (89.01%) the (88.92%) weather (39.04%) boundary (62.50%) we (61.77%) import (41.28%) your. (80.62%) I (82.86%) have (54.88%) I (70.85%) have (80.42%) set (96.88%) of (84.96%) plugins (78.96%) motion (97.75%) synthesis (89.65%) hand (32.37%) plugins (43.82%) basically (99.85%) anything (99.80%) in (99.61%) that (99.85%) code (98.97%) base, (76.86%) I (83.50%) own. (52.05%) You (95.17%) give (44.60%) come (42.75%) with (34.47%) that (95.07%) code, (97.51%) You (84.13%) come (92.72%) to (92.29%) me. (51.76%) You (89.99%) you (91.21%) wanna (86.28%) make (99.90%) changes (99.95%) in (91.36%) that (93.95%) code. (66.80%) That's (99.51%) fine. (99.90%) But (98.68%) come (98.29%) talk (95.46%) to (99.17%) me (99.66%) and (99.17%) we'll (98.63%) talk (97.85%) about (98.19%) how (98.24%) to (99.66%) make (98.93%) sure (99.07%) that (89.65%) we (76.07%) minimize. (95.02%) So (98.93%) any (99.61%) code (67.29%) that (99.61%) needs (99.51%) to (98.58%) be (97.07%) for (98.54%) a (95.12%) game, (91.94%) I'll (94.14%) I'll (99.76%) add (99.80%) an (96.39%) interface (99.85%) or (94.29%) we'll (97.31%) talk (99.76%) about (97.02%) a (55.91%) ways (98.00%) to (96.44%) make (99.27%) sure (99.66%) that (97.66%) you (99.37%) can (99.51%) do (98.97%) it. (98.83%) For (98.83%) frostbite (98.63%) side, (51.81%) since (98.29%) it's (81.25%) a (94.82%) plug (55.32%) in, (66.55%) I (98.93%) also (99.02%) need (99.02%) to (97.61%) make (98.88%) changes (94.48%) to (54.98%) quite (22.89%) occasionally. (99.71%) So (99.27%) I (98.39%) work (93.12%) with (99.17%) the (59.57%) cross (48.56%) team (95.17%) to (51.22%) say, (97.75%) hey.

(75.44%) Or (90.53%) look (86.47%) my (93.65%) my (99.51%) plug (54.49%) are (96.92%) exposing (95.26%) a (93.31%) bug (82.42%) in (90.53%) your (98.00%) code. (94.19%) Can (99.07%) we (99.17%) work (99.61%) together (93.41%) fix (93.80%) that (92.38%) So (98.14%) it's (98.97%) pretty (98.39%) isolated (96.63%) in (78.96%) a (75.15%) sense (95.90%) of (86.77%) clear (96.44%) boundaries (93.21%) about (96.09%) what (99.12%) is (78.47%) mine (86.28%) versus (99.51%) what (98.73%) is (45.75%) frostbite (96.97%) and (86.72%) what (94.38%) it (35.16%) who's (36.87%) responsible (60.35%) quality (55.47%) I'm (83.64%) responsible (99.27%) And (67.58%) my (98.83%) team (99.07%) is (99.51%) responsible.
