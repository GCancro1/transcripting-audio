Total Confidence:  (96.19%)

I (86.52%) think (93.51%) that (99.02%) people (98.88%) with... (30.64%) That (94.29%) could (99.17%) be (99.51%) due (93.99%) to. (87.21%) A (87.26%) certain (64.94%) job (96.92%) or (99.46%) if (92.14%) they (98.10%) are (98.88%) doing (98.73%) overtime (98.10%) science (20.17%) time (57.08%) their (70.70%) federal, (33.72%) then (96.97%) that (99.41%) could (99.56%) also (99.46%) be (98.88%) a (95.41%) reason. (95.85%) Body (37.55%) would (67.14%) leave (99.22%) their (99.46%) job. (74.12%) If (99.80%) the (97.36%) pay (90.67%) is (94.68%) too (99.37%) low (99.27%) their (89.11%) job (90.43%) if (96.68%) there (96.97%) is (96.44%) a (95.85%) complex (68.85%) with (51.81%) a (63.53%) coworker, (76.51%) then (98.68%) they (99.27%) could (99.12%) also (99.46%) leave (95.51%) their (94.29%) job (99.41%) not (98.39%) satisfied (78.86%) their (98.73%) job. (99.76%) I (99.51%) think (99.90%) that (98.49%) the (99.90%) main (99.95%) reason (99.95%) why (92.77%) I (90.92%) want (90.33%) to (95.31%) stay (98.05%) in (98.68%) a (81.40%) job (99.12%) k. (40.87%) Right (99.90%) now, (92.68%) I (98.68%) really (99.90%) need (99.85%) money. (99.95%) So (96.09%) the (85.99%) more (99.76%) money (100.00%) I (99.90%) can (99.07%) get, (99.76%) the (95.65%) more (99.27%) likely (99.61%) it (98.58%) is (99.07%) that (99.56%) I (99.41%) would (77.83%) paying (78.71%) in (68.36%) a (93.75%) job.
