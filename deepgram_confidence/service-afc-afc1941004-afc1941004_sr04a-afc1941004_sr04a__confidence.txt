(99.22%) But (98.63%) weren't (97.22%) we (87.11%) a (98.78%) little (99.07%) bit (99.51%) used (97.07%) to (99.22%) the (99.56%) Id (62.99%) that (98.58%) we (99.71%) wanted (97.07%) to (99.61%) avoid (99.95%) everything (99.61%) at (99.07%) all (79.59%) cost (80.27%) and (99.17%) then (96.53%) there's (45.26%) sudden (99.37%) foreign (99.02%) war (58.69%) policy (99.27%) throwing (34.35%) a (48.68%) upon (98.88%) us (62.40%) was (97.80%) rather (99.61%) a (96.58%) shock (99.32%) to (99.22%) this (99.66%) generation (99.71%) because (99.66%) If (64.21%) one (72.22%) was (99.56%) rather (99.90%) surprised (92.87%) at (96.63%) the (96.97%) congressman (85.30%) the (99.27%) other (99.71%) day (99.32%) cheering (97.12%) so (84.96%) enthusiastically, (95.61%) and (98.49%) yet, (68.31%) I (99.66%) think (98.73%) if (91.80%) I (98.68%) were (97.85%) there, (99.37%) I (53.71%) probably (36.55%) would (50.49%) I'm (66.89%) done (99.66%) the (99.56%) same (99.95%) thing. (97.17%) Yes. (90.43%) The (98.97%) idea (99.85%) I (99.76%) think (99.76%) has (99.76%) been (100.00%) instilled (94.58%) into (94.68%) the (83.79%) minds (97.31%) of (99.22%) the (68.07%) use (89.55%) of (99.41%) this (98.63%) country (100.00%) ever (99.80%) since (99.90%) the (98.93%) world (99.61%) war (97.51%) that (87.60%) at (55.71%) war (96.53%) is (87.65%) the (96.78%) greatest (98.29%) of (98.88%) all (99.66%) evils. (88.92%) Mister (87.01%) Fox (98.10%) getting (97.90%) back (75.88%) what (82.28%) you (97.07%) said (99.12%) just (98.19%) a (97.56%) moment (99.76%) ago, (98.73%) you (98.83%) said (94.04%) that (87.79%) you (98.29%) believed (98.00%) in (71.58%) helping (97.71%) great (96.39%) Britain (100.00%) and (70.80%) the (98.73%) other (99.61%) democracies (98.19%) when (55.32%) this (81.35%) war (98.44%) by (99.37%) every (99.27%) mean (60.99%) short (96.48%) of (95.46%) war. (99.61%) In (99.76%) other (99.95%) words, (97.66%) you (66.11%) do (76.17%) not (89.55%) the (81.69%) the (96.83%) United (100.00%) States (99.95%) is (96.48%) war (95.70%) with (66.36%) Germany (99.90%) at (99.90%) the (99.07%) present (99.95%) time (99.27%) to (95.36%) the (97.22%) same (80.13%) extent (99.90%) to (84.23%) which (97.85%) she (86.18%) is (97.80%) with (99.71%) Japan. (94.87%) I (99.66%) would (99.32%) say (99.95%) morally (95.90%) yes, (79.15%) but (99.71%) looking (99.95%) at (98.19%) the (99.07%) problem (99.46%) realistically (99.95%) and (98.00%) practically, (99.71%) I (99.37%) believe (99.61%) that (97.61%) as (88.87%) a (98.83%) military (60.21%) standpoint, (99.46%) it (98.78%) is (73.05%) far (94.14%) better (99.56%) to (99.56%) fight (99.90%) on (99.37%) one (97.75%) front (41.94%) and (69.34%) on (96.19%) two. (90.53%) By (99.85%) concentrating (97.90%) our (99.76%) efforts (99.85%) on (96.88%) Japan (99.90%) i (80.76%) the (50.00%) obtained (24.57%) we (97.12%) can (88.96%) knock (98.97%) out (83.25%) of (84.62%) the (97.51%) war (92.48%) much (97.75%) more (97.36%) rapidly (99.95%) than (99.76%) we (99.66%) can (99.95%) if (97.95%) our (99.80%) effort (59.47%) to (87.94%) split (99.56%) by (99.80%) an (98.93%) Ae (66.60%) for (93.46%) example (99.85%) in (95.75%) Africa (99.80%) and (89.16%) an (99.02%) atlantic (88.53%) fleet, (95.95%) which (99.22%) must (99.80%) see (95.21%) action (99.22%) in (99.80%) the (99.85%) Atlantic (100.00%) don't (45.78%) forget (96.14%) that's (52.34%) just (98.05%) exactly (99.66%) what (96.73%) hitler (42.82%) wants (99.76%) us (77.54%) to (99.85%) do. (99.37%) If (99.51%) we (99.41%) concentrate (99.32%) entirely (99.80%) upon (14.65%) bend (57.81%) and (77.15%) we (83.06%) must (92.09%) stop (88.92%) our (71.63%) full (57.32%) of (97.12%) goods (99.66%) to (98.73%) great (83.11%) Britain (100.00%) in (65.04%) Russia. (96.48%) Evidently (98.14%) the (96.78%) grand (97.85%) strategy (99.07%) back (91.75%) of (97.51%) the (96.78%) axis (50.10%) ours (73.58%) is (98.63%) to (99.80%) divert (99.95%) our (98.49%) form (33.59%) materials. (76.76%) But (99.12%) according (100.00%) to (99.95%) what (98.54%) the (99.41%) president (99.32%) said (99.46%) in (88.92%) his (99.46%) speech (99.85%) last (99.90%) night (99.71%) he (92.63%) is (94.34%) intending (98.63%) to (99.80%) continue (99.80%) our (99.07%) shipments (99.22%) to (98.05%) Russia (94.29%) and (96.88%) new (49.98%) England. (88.82%) I (75.78%) like (82.81%) called (56.30%) him (33.35%) as (69.53%) Foster (96.68%) attention, (99.22%) the (95.70%) fact (99.95%) that (99.27%) the (99.46%) only (99.22%) road (97.75%) left (99.90%) to (97.56%) Russia (99.85%) is (97.56%) now (99.46%) the (97.71%) road (74.41%) through (80.52%) Persia. (99.17%) And (38.77%) a (72.56%) lot (95.70%) of (98.05%) a (41.21%) stock (90.53%) lines (44.46%) behind (99.85%) the (99.46%) Japanese (100.00%) archipelago (85.50%) Therefore, (99.76%) I (99.76%) believe (99.85%) that (99.41%) we (98.24%) can (99.07%) help (97.80%) russia (91.31%) by (98.73%) sending (98.88%) only (52.49%) supplies (99.71%) to (91.16%) Persia. (97.95%) But (98.58%) if (99.61%) we (99.51%) do (98.10%) get (99.66%) into (96.88%) the (98.73%) war (99.02%) with (99.37%) German (85.84%) It (98.63%) means (99.12%) splitting (99.90%) our (91.94%) resources (99.80%) and (93.85%) justice (79.98%) as (59.08%) Germany (93.41%) did (91.65%) not (87.06%) want (98.58%) to (86.91%) fight (99.56%) on (67.63%) more (99.41%) than (99.37%) one (99.66%) front. (95.41%) Neither (97.51%) should (94.14%) we. (59.62%) In (99.66%) regard (95.65%) to (98.63%) that, (99.76%) we (99.37%) don't (95.21%) even (99.66%) know (97.95%) Russia (78.03%) stand (43.53%) yet. (99.32%) Yes (32.98%) in (95.17%) Germany, (99.71%) Germany (89.70%) is (94.78%) the (93.07%) base (93.41%) for (99.76%) the (99.90%) whole (99.95%) thing. (100.00%) I (99.41%) think (98.68%) it (58.50%) we (51.46%) should (29.08%) get (87.26%) at (96.83%) the (99.17%) base (94.14%) of (97.07%) this (52.78%) thing (61.38%) instead (98.93%) of (95.75%) going (99.56%) around (84.67%) the (96.44%) fringes (98.24%) and (91.99%) taking (98.97%) the (99.27%) longest (99.80%) way (99.12%) and (93.55%) just (86.52%) go (97.66%) to (96.04%) the (93.51%) base (50.54%) and (81.98%) wipe (99.37%) that (99.80%) out, (99.27%) and (98.44%) then (99.37%) the (99.66%) whole (99.90%) thing (99.85%) will (98.54%) be (99.22%) so. (32.91%) And (79.64%) you (98.34%) would (85.79%) favor (99.71%) an (97.22%) immediate (99.90%) declaration (90.43%) of (88.87%) war, (92.87%) I (78.32%) against (50.93%) Germany. (99.76%) That's (74.76%) right. (90.87%) Well, (99.07%) it (99.27%) hasn't (98.39%) been (99.66%) our (83.64%) policy (99.41%) in (99.76%) the (99.46%) past (99.90%) to (92.09%) do (96.29%) well (48.32%) I (84.38%) I (96.92%) think. (96.92%) We've (97.61%) gone (95.65%) too (96.19%) much (98.88%) on (98.29%) tradition (94.97%) now (99.61%) and (92.58%) that's (95.80%) reason (84.81%) is (41.89%) Pearl (99.76%) Harbor (97.90%) incident (96.68%) has (86.13%) come (96.14%) out. (99.41%) We (95.36%) have (94.53%) thought (99.71%) of (99.51%) this (99.12%) non (84.86%) combat (78.47%) tradition (93.90%) of (72.12%) the (87.40%) United (100.00%) States. (99.66%) And (64.01%) I (95.21%) think (99.12%) we (92.19%) we're (32.06%) pooling (58.94%) around (99.61%) with (99.61%) ideologies (38.50%) and (83.25%) get (76.27%) down (97.75%) to (81.79%) actual (99.80%) fighting (94.19%) and (95.95%) what (98.68%) is (88.57%) really (99.32%) happening (99.76%) here (96.78%) in (99.56%) the (99.85%) world. (99.90%) Don't (84.13%) that's (43.04%) what (90.19%) time (99.80%) we (99.80%) have (98.05%) before (100.00%) we (99.71%) go (99.85%) to (99.85%) where (87.65%) with (39.23%) Germany, (86.62%) the (93.02%) more (99.76%) war (54.25%) claims (32.86%) we (99.32%) have (97.41%) the (41.50%) more (99.46%) equipment (99.66%) we (98.68%) have (97.27%) the (90.87%) better (100.00%) preparation (98.24%) we (99.71%) have. (98.88%) If (88.09%) we (98.93%) can (95.65%) put (99.46%) it (94.34%) off (96.58%) two (99.61%) weeks, (99.90%) then (98.88%) we (98.58%) have (49.98%) just (87.99%) two (99.95%) weeks (95.80%) vantage (56.84%) on (98.14%) Supply. (91.16%) I'd (63.28%) like (93.65%) to (98.88%) make (99.46%) just (97.17%) one (99.56%) more (97.51%) point (98.19%) and (92.77%) that (97.95%) is (95.75%) that (53.52%) we (99.32%) have (99.66%) no (99.51%) common (96.14%) battlefield (95.21%) field (62.70%) that (52.49%) we (49.54%) Germany (97.95%) on. (91.75%) Against (98.24%) Japan, (99.90%) it (84.67%) is (94.68%) true (99.12%) that (96.14%) we (99.71%) can (70.21%) meet (87.40%) them (99.90%) at (99.51%) sea (94.63%) since (98.68%) they (99.76%) have (97.95%) a (47.49%) navy (95.46%) and (65.67%) we (98.97%) have (98.73%) also. (99.41%) Germany (99.76%) on (98.24%) the (99.85%) other (99.80%) hand (99.95%) has (98.39%) virtually (100.00%) no (52.15%) navy, (99.51%) we (99.17%) will (48.10%) have (99.46%) to (99.07%) send (99.85%) an (96.39%) Ae (95.75%) f (8.26%) to (99.07%) Africa, (99.85%) which (98.58%) there (87.65%) is (56.59%) at (78.03%) present (76.61%) around (42.38%) the (56.05%) strong (99.32%) force (96.00%) of (99.66%) British (98.29%) which (91.36%) are (56.88%) at (88.38%) the (97.71%) moment (98.88%) of (51.22%) these (68.75%) successful. (94.97%) Mister (67.68%) Fox, (94.53%) do (99.46%) you (99.37%) feel (99.90%) that (97.46%) we (98.19%) must (99.37%) see (99.80%) the (99.76%) eventually (78.96%) feet (52.98%) of (99.41%) Germany (99.85%) before (99.56%) we (99.46%) can (98.68%) see (98.78%) any (98.78%) kind (99.56%) of (98.54%) a (67.72%) piece. (63.09%) Then (91.75%) what (89.40%) of (53.71%) course (95.90%) do (97.90%) you (99.56%) recommend (99.51%) that (98.83%) we (97.85%) follow (98.88%) in (98.39%) order (99.76%) to (99.80%) achieve (99.90%) that (98.54%) defeat. (99.80%) Well, (89.50%) I (88.92%) say (63.87%) made (61.04%) to (97.36%) retain (97.02%) our (93.12%) presence (72.75%) status (94.53%) toward (60.60%) Germany (99.32%) and. (51.76%) It (97.56%) is (97.61%) a (76.90%) status (97.51%) of (97.41%) actual (98.83%) non (61.08%) bell (78.81%) in (54.39%) other (99.85%) words, (99.85%) we're (66.21%) at (96.39%) war, (86.08%) morally (99.41%) emotionally (99.95%) and (98.88%) physically, (99.85%) but (99.95%) we're (97.80%) not (99.71%) actually (98.05%) fighting. (99.90%) And (98.34%) yet (98.34%) I (84.18%) say, (97.12%) continue (95.36%) to (99.66%) fight (99.90%) the (98.73%) Japanese (99.95%) in (98.88%) an (99.51%) actual (99.17%) armed (94.78%) way. (97.17%) Eventually, (99.95%) I (99.41%) feel (98.49%) that (80.03%) Japan (99.71%) be (98.49%) the (98.78%) first (99.80%) to (61.96%) drop (84.91%) out (99.07%) from (63.82%) a (70.02%) matter (99.51%) of (99.90%) tune (29.39%) internal (99.76%) weakness, (98.78%) then (99.41%) we (99.17%) can (97.61%) turn (99.41%) our (98.44%) attention (99.85%) completely (95.12%) to (99.71%) the (99.85%) Germans (89.70%) after (99.61%) having (99.76%) eliminated (95.90%) one (95.75%) phone (38.50%) completely. (99.56%) Do (51.81%) you (71.73%) feel (85.45%) an (79.69%) expedition (85.16%) force (35.35%) sent (94.14%) to (97.85%) the (99.56%) continental (68.41%) of (98.97%) Europe, (99.41%) to (47.39%) fight (45.83%) Germany (99.95%) will (99.61%) be (99.66%) necessary, (99.22%) eventually, (99.71%) yes, (98.29%) eventually. (99.80%) Right (28.64%) surprisingly (57.52%) much (66.21%) disposed (47.00%) of (63.72%) japan. (90.14%) I (99.76%) believe (99.76%) so. (90.09%) Manager. (71.63%) You (91.16%) may (53.56%) not (60.89%) didn't (50.93%) have (97.02%) any (99.37%) common (84.62%) battle (54.69%) for. (30.37%) We're (60.35%) on (90.04%) Iceland (72.02%) when (91.46%) we (99.27%) have (91.06%) an (49.46%) occupied. (97.90%) We (96.73%) could (90.77%) fly (60.45%) from (99.37%) Iceland (99.80%) to (98.34%) the (99.41%) continent (98.97%) and (97.31%) back, (87.26%) and (99.56%) we (99.37%) would (99.66%) have (99.76%) a (99.56%) common (97.12%) battlefield (63.67%) there. (98.24%) About (59.96%) an (97.75%) ae (34.28%) up (62.79%) to (59.67%) the (80.32%) Avian (67.43%) countries. (97.75%) You'll (71.04%) have (98.93%) to (95.31%) land (96.63%) at (78.96%) Norway, (99.95%) which (99.37%) is (99.32%) a (49.78%) president (57.67%) control (98.88%) of (97.56%) the (64.45%) of (92.77%) the (97.07%) German. (73.68%) Sweden (100.00%) Is (69.43%) islam (12.96%) is (47.92%) a (92.33%) neutral (99.76%) and (78.17%) Feel (60.69%) circuit (53.76%) where (44.36%) any (41.77%) attempt (96.83%) made (87.06%) to (61.91%) land (94.82%) on (98.29%) Sweden (95.07%) with (55.57%) call (73.73%) the (46.26%) systems (53.08%) of (69.34%) Germany. (99.27%) Well, (76.07%) about (34.91%) South (100.00%) America's (88.67%) position (53.08%) in (93.07%) this (67.77%) too. (92.38%) I (99.71%) think (99.90%) that's (99.46%) a (81.15%) pretty (99.66%) important (99.17%) one (88.48%) that (46.68%) we (99.32%) haven't (70.90%) brought (99.61%) in (97.51%) as (99.76%) far (99.90%) as (99.80%) the (99.71%) concentration (99.71%) of (99.17%) German (99.41%) feeling (88.23%) in (99.90%) those (99.66%) countries. (99.90%) Well, (95.51%) the (45.61%) several (82.96%) these (35.50%) malls (38.06%) South (99.95%) American (99.41%) countries (99.80%) have (93.26%) declared (100.00%) war (99.90%) and (99.76%) others (99.80%) have (98.39%) said (99.85%) that (99.66%) they (99.76%) will (98.24%) not (99.61%) recognize (99.85%) the (65.62%) state (99.07%) of (97.75%) bell (91.89%) between (99.85%) the (75.54%) United (98.93%) states (98.19%) in (60.06%) Japan, (99.95%) which (99.56%) is (95.36%) in (95.95%) the (97.66%) favor (98.44%) of (98.49%) the (99.61%) United (100.00%) States (99.95%) because (99.90%) it (97.46%) means (99.76%) that (88.72%) we (97.75%) can (96.34%) use (98.93%) their (98.19%) poor (41.55%) just (97.02%) as (99.61%) we (99.22%) could (67.53%) in (96.39%) time (92.33%) at (82.57%) least. (94.82%) I (99.56%) think (99.37%) they (76.61%) all (94.43%) definitely (96.97%) sympathetic (99.66%) Of (98.78%) course, (99.12%) they (94.53%) have (97.41%) been (99.71%) someone (81.45%) on (45.85%) the (80.96%) position (91.26%) in (39.26%) Japan (99.95%) has (99.07%) been (98.83%) in (83.35%) naming (48.51%) that (97.02%) they (99.07%) want (98.93%) to (99.51%) be (99.17%) on (99.56%) the (99.66%) winning (99.85%) side, (99.85%) but (88.72%) they (98.49%) are (99.27%) so (97.41%) close (98.34%) to (99.76%) the (92.14%) United (99.95%) States. (100.00%) And (58.15%) I (98.88%) think (99.85%) that (96.63%) they (99.80%) all (98.83%) realize (89.60%) that (99.12%) their (98.63%) destin (85.16%) are (99.66%) pretty (90.97%) inevitably (95.41%) wrapped (99.85%) up (99.66%) with (97.46%) those (95.85%) of (56.15%) we (34.03%) united (99.90%) States. (99.90%) I (99.41%) don't (99.61%) think (99.85%) that (94.14%) any (99.80%) of (99.90%) us (82.91%) are (97.95%) alarmed (97.95%) over (83.30%) the... (93.26%) What (98.93%) the (45.92%) south (89.75%) American (99.85%) countries (99.07%) might (99.56%) do (98.44%) and (87.45%) this (46.68%) regard (67.19%) this (46.90%) war (51.71%) are. (34.11%) I (87.65%) don't (85.89%) know (35.89%) there (95.65%) isn't (98.83%) much (99.12%) it (70.46%) can (99.02%) do. (99.37%) They're (95.65%) forced (95.51%) to (99.66%) do (99.37%) whatever (99.90%) they (77.25%) are (95.95%) doing (99.80%) if (56.88%) they (93.65%) did (75.63%) want (58.59%) to (52.44%) stay (50.88%) different. (95.02%) I (79.98%) think (94.29%) because (87.84%) they're (40.26%) in (56.40%) relationship (99.17%) with (100.00%) the (81.05%) United (99.95%) States, (99.85%) it (70.07%) would (94.09%) be (98.83%) cut (99.02%) off (99.41%) completely (99.90%) economically (99.90%) and (96.92%) physically (99.07%) and (62.79%) then (51.51%) every (99.76%) other (99.46%) way. (93.51%) Well, (81.93%) I (98.34%) think (97.17%) that (45.07%) we're (82.81%) all (99.07%) pretty (99.80%) generally (75.98%) agreed (99.41%) then (48.19%) that (80.62%) the (97.31%) United (100.00%) States (99.95%) must (99.95%) see (88.96%) the (98.44%) eventual (96.88%) defeat (97.75%) of (99.85%) the (99.32%) axis (77.73%) powers (97.31%) in (99.85%) order (99.12%) to (99.85%) achieve (99.95%) a (97.02%) peace. (57.13%) I (65.67%) believe. (96.88%) I (99.12%) think (99.85%) that's (99.02%) more (99.90%) or (98.78%) less (99.95%) universally (99.61%) consented (99.85%) to (88.13%) with (46.46%) this (99.07%) discussion. (99.90%) Well, (97.71%) now (99.12%) after (99.61%) this (99.76%) war (99.37%) is (96.00%) over, (99.71%) going (99.61%) to (99.07%) have (99.51%) a (99.71%) problem (99.90%) which (99.80%) is (99.37%) even (99.90%) more (99.80%) important. (99.85%) And (97.90%) that (98.63%) is (98.14%) this. (54.00%) Just (98.34%) what (96.04%) part (98.97%) of (75.63%) the (89.26%) United (100.00%) States (100.00%) can, (96.48%) will (65.58%) play (99.85%) in (93.80%) the (99.37%) formation (99.66%) of (99.51%) some (99.80%) kind (99.71%) of (99.46%) a (94.73%) post (97.95%) war (34.79%) world (96.83%) mister (98.83%) Fox. (99.22%) When (40.77%) buy (26.81%) hangs, (94.38%) I (96.53%) believe (99.17%) the (99.56%) entire (99.32%) problem (99.46%) i (55.47%) think (99.61%) personally (99.27%) that (98.93%) if (98.24%) the (99.27%) United (100.00%) States (100.00%) will (98.19%) take (99.61%) part (42.36%) in (59.28%) the (98.58%) Peace (80.91%) treaty (99.71%) and (46.09%) we (94.34%) will. (96.34%) We (98.29%) shouldn't (99.71%) make (99.85%) the (98.93%) mistakes (95.90%) that (78.86%) we (99.07%) made (97.61%) back (90.87%) at (42.53%) for (53.86%) sigh (22.27%) in (76.90%) nineteen (98.68%) hundred (68.46%) seventeen (83.50%) and (67.29%) eighteen (85.99%) and (89.36%) which (96.92%) caused (97.27%) us (98.93%) to (91.75%) remain (98.19%) at (98.29%) war, (82.42%) officially (89.79%) with (94.48%) Germany (93.90%) to (64.01%) twenties. (65.09%) If (98.97%) we (98.24%) are (97.17%) going (99.85%) to (99.71%) set (98.14%) up (97.51%) an (98.93%) international (99.61%) association (99.71%) of (99.76%) nations, (98.73%) then (87.06%) we (99.76%) must (99.85%) be (99.90%) in (99.76%) it. (99.66%) We (72.61%) must (97.46%) give (99.12%) that (99.51%) association (97.17%) some (99.46%) form (100.00%) of (99.51%) teeth (70.65%) so (98.88%) that (99.07%) it (99.76%) will (99.32%) work. (99.90%) Certainly, (98.83%) if (99.51%) Germany (99.95%) is (92.97%) beaten, (98.34%) we (99.51%) cannot (100.00%) kick (78.42%) her (50.78%) when (91.41%) it's (92.29%) down (99.76%) because (99.56%) the (99.90%) same (99.95%) situation (99.95%) will (99.32%) occur (99.95%) at (98.58%) the (99.71%) end (99.90%) of (99.90%) twenty (99.80%) years (99.76%) that (51.51%) has (99.66%) occurred (99.61%) now. (99.61%) A (99.37%) great (99.76%) I (7.48%) feel (73.24%) to (92.19%) blame (99.61%) for (97.02%) this (99.95%) war (99.27%) must (99.90%) be (99.95%) laid (67.92%) at (99.51%) the (99.66%) doors (99.17%) of (99.66%) those (99.46%) nations (99.80%) which (99.51%) were (85.79%) victorious (99.90%) in (98.93%) the (99.80%) last (99.27%) world (98.29%) war. (99.80%) And (90.48%) then (77.93%) the (24.17%) course (37.43%) is (96.97%) our (99.07%) leading (99.56%) policy (93.90%) so (99.76%) far (99.51%) as (96.68%) work (52.25%) turn. (59.42%) I've (46.17%) said (55.42%) that (62.89%) we (99.41%) cannot (99.56%) kick (76.61%) Germany (99.80%) down (99.85%) and (98.58%) keep (97.07%) her (89.50%) down. (61.28%) There's (80.42%) always (99.95%) a (94.97%) possibility (99.71%) that (99.76%) we (99.61%) can (89.36%) keep (99.71%) her (98.29%) down (96.92%) as (98.83%) we (99.51%) did (99.17%) not (97.90%) do (99.41%) after (80.76%) the (97.41%) last (98.54%) world (93.31%) war. (99.41%) We (99.22%) kicked (81.88%) her (64.21%) down (96.39%) but (70.80%) we (76.37%) let (71.68%) get (96.63%) back (98.34%) then (95.65%) may (94.29%) I (99.37%) ask (99.12%) one (99.80%) question (99.95%) to (72.95%) those (97.71%) people (99.22%) who (95.80%) are (98.19%) here, (91.06%) Do (94.19%) you (98.63%) believe (99.56%) it's (83.54%) Christian, (39.62%) You (83.84%) know, (63.82%) or (38.67%) do (96.24%) you (98.24%) believe (99.80%) it's (98.44%) even (99.61%) decent (97.27%) or (97.51%) democratic (99.80%) to (84.52%) carry (98.78%) on (97.02%) that (97.27%) sort (97.75%) of (94.34%) a (79.05%) policy (99.56%) toward. (57.86%) But (61.04%) I (92.77%) don't (99.02%) think (98.49%) it's (91.60%) good (94.14%) then. (17.80%) It (98.63%) doesn't (99.56%) seem (99.90%) practical. (38.35%) I (88.62%) think (26.56%) got (32.32%) fights (83.06%) with (64.21%) the (78.91%) German (99.95%) government, (99.61%) not (99.22%) with (98.97%) the (98.49%) German (99.95%) people. (99.66%) I (83.06%) agree (72.46%) that (64.21%) yes, (99.46%) the (71.58%) telling (12.13%) been (23.01%) German (99.80%) government (99.66%) is (63.04%) the (95.26%) german (98.97%) people (96.39%) didn't (45.58%) sanction (96.63%) that (68.12%) Hitler (99.95%) can't (85.45%) quite (46.29%) the (75.54%) war (99.56%) himself (59.86%) he (95.07%) can't (99.76%) form (83.06%) all (99.66%) the (98.68%) public (99.41%) dependent (39.75%) and (33.33%) someone. (95.90%) It's (51.86%) put (87.94%) there. (95.07%) Just (71.97%) the (99.51%) same (99.46%) as (95.65%) all (99.90%) leaders (20.29%) are (49.19%) put. (54.79%) They (99.56%) have (85.84%) to (99.56%) have (77.78%) a (77.49%) backing (89.06%) someone (73.73%) behind (100.00%) them. (84.57%) They (94.19%) can't (21.88%) go (80.81%) they're (46.48%) bear (31.62%) fist. (46.97%) And (97.27%) say (96.88%) come (99.22%) on (98.63%) boys (81.20%) all (91.99%) you (94.58%) follow (92.92%) me. (99.51%) Well, (98.73%) then (99.76%) again, (99.17%) you've (66.31%) got (91.16%) a (58.69%) look (97.36%) at (69.19%) at (92.58%) the (93.70%) Germany, (99.85%) which (99.66%) resulted (67.43%) from (99.76%) what (99.90%) we (99.61%) did (99.85%) and (96.73%) what (99.07%) we (99.12%) didn't (99.66%) carry (99.90%) on. (67.48%) Because (99.76%) Hitler (99.95%) himself (99.95%) is (96.53%) a (99.27%) product (99.80%) of (97.85%) we (99.66%) might (99.85%) say (94.34%) of (98.54%) what (99.17%) we (97.51%) as (66.11%) an (99.32%) entire (99.71%) group (99.95%) of (99.95%) nations (98.10%) did (36.52%) then, (94.78%) German (94.63%) people (97.85%) where (55.62%) you're (85.64%) ready (79.74%) for. (44.07%) Out (88.23%) on (93.60%) a (80.47%) little (98.73%) space (54.15%) of (84.23%) his (50.54%) zone (81.15%) and (96.00%) say (91.41%) he's (78.37%) a (43.82%) is (47.71%) said... (52.69%) Well, (87.35%) no (75.44%) worries (54.64%) worry. (65.23%) No. (86.18%) You (98.29%) can't. (85.64%) You (99.12%) can't (97.90%) hope (88.13%) when (99.61%) I (97.41%) saved (74.76%) to (56.54%) kid (52.93%) to (71.92%) kick (84.38%) Germany (93.95%) and (96.14%) keep (95.36%) it (65.14%) down. (99.41%) What (99.95%) would (90.67%) you (98.63%) do__?__ (99.46%) I (98.63%) mean, (95.56%) you (99.46%) can't (99.80%) weigh (38.38%) about (35.77%) an (46.02%) entire (89.40%) people (99.07%) even (99.85%) Hitler's (54.30%) drive (34.06%) found (86.33%) it (71.09%) extremely (98.29%) on (43.99%) successful. (97.31%) So (98.68%) I (99.07%) think (99.17%) that (98.78%) a (87.70%) just (92.04%) beneficial (100.00%) piece (96.19%) must (99.71%) come (99.66%) out (99.85%) of (94.92%) this. (96.83%) And (98.39%) furthermore, (100.00%) I (99.90%) believe (99.95%) this (99.46%) piece (94.92%) must (99.95%) be (99.76%) based (99.90%) on (99.51%) a (58.45%) disarm (97.41%) power (38.45%) Well, (82.81%) you (93.85%) don't (93.21%) think (96.09%) then (59.62%) that (91.89%) it (85.74%) will (90.53%) be (99.80%) wise (97.61%) not (35.86%) necessary (99.22%) for (98.83%) the (99.17%) United (99.95%) States (99.90%) to (97.95%) police (94.87%) the (99.85%) world (98.73%) so (99.02%) to (98.24%) speak (97.61%) after (99.80%) this (94.92%) war (98.93%) over. (99.46%) Why (87.55%) no. (95.90%) I (85.69%) think (47.31%) that's (96.63%) going (99.76%) back (99.80%) to (98.88%) the (98.97%) dark. (91.99%) Mike (74.51%) I (39.92%) disagree (88.96%) agree (76.42%) with (99.76%) you. (98.93%) I (98.29%) thought (99.80%) you (99.27%) were (98.68%) getting (98.83%) at (80.18%) another (99.71%) point. (99.56%) When (98.97%) I (98.93%) said (98.93%) four, (34.84%) I (99.22%) meant (99.32%) that (98.29%) as (98.19%) an (97.12%) a (57.03%) step (93.46%) towards (99.02%) reconstruction, (97.85%) you (99.61%) wouldn't (85.79%) assess (31.59%) that (97.51%) he (64.31%) have (53.08%) to (98.97%) use (99.51%) force. (92.29%) Otherwise, (100.00%) you (58.50%) have (99.07%) the (99.85%) same (99.76%) thing (98.00%) reoccurring. (87.89%) And (99.46%) that's (99.46%) what (96.48%) we (99.56%) didn't (99.51%) do. (97.90%) If (96.97%) you (97.75%) have (94.14%) international (100.00%) police (100.00%) force, (99.17%) which (99.27%) apparently (97.36%) the (52.59%) United (100.00%) States (99.95%) is (99.17%) going (99.85%) to (99.02%) supply, (99.07%) then (92.92%) you're (75.98%) simply (99.90%) going (98.10%) to (98.78%) leave (87.70%) the (99.27%) world (92.68%) one (83.40%) way. (39.62%)
