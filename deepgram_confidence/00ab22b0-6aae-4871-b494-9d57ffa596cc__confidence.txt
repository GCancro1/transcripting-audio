(90.92%) And (97.12%) which (99.56%) of (95.80%) you (96.14%) by (36.38%) being (68.26%) anxious (98.88%) can (99.37%) add (99.76%) a (99.90%) single (99.61%) hour (99.76%) to (97.41%) span (90.87%) of (84.38%) life__?__ (99.32%) Both (99.90%) of (98.58%) those (84.38%) versus (75.05%) are (72.75%) commands (95.17%) i (41.38%) god. (88.33%) This (99.61%) is (97.46%) shown (98.05%) by (96.04%) the (98.68%) direct (99.66%) phrase (97.80%) do (76.12%) not, (91.65%) which (98.78%) I've (85.69%) highlighted. (99.95%) There (99.27%) are (97.66%) always (72.51%) reasons (99.51%) why (100.00%) god (97.12%) gives (96.04%) us (49.22%) commands.

(73.05%) And (99.17%) in (99.56%) this (99.80%) case, (99.90%) anxiety (97.85%) can (99.90%) be (99.85%) physically (99.95%) harmful.

(96.88%) Cortisol (93.26%) is (95.07%) supposed (99.17%) to (99.17%) be (99.85%) produced (95.51%) in (98.19%) the (99.32%) body (99.56%) and (99.80%) stored (54.88%) up (99.51%) for (99.41%) a (95.95%) fight (99.32%) or (58.74%) flight (98.24%) response.

(98.83%) But (99.41%) burdens, (19.14%) we (98.63%) can (98.10%) relate (76.42%) to (87.06%) today (67.14%) to (83.94%) help (64.26%) family (99.80%) death, (43.16%) financial (98.78%) problems, (96.92%) bad, (50.88%) no (99.85%) matter (99.90%) how (99.95%) hard (98.14%) you (96.53%) studied.

(99.02%) Paul (99.41%) did (93.60%) not (99.46%) worry (99.80%) about (99.85%) his (99.95%) current (99.90%) situation (59.42%) no (98.83%) matter (100.00%) how (98.73%) stream (42.04%) they (96.34%) were (91.06%) compared (99.66%) to (99.95%) us. (99.46%) But (99.27%) he (99.22%) knew (98.73%) that (98.00%) everything (99.71%) was (99.46%) ultimately (99.80%) controlled (99.61%) by (86.96%) god, (96.78%) who (57.62%) he (99.32%) trusted (96.83%) in. (68.95%) This (99.80%) is (97.02%) the (76.61%) same (93.65%) call (66.65%) who (57.96%) wrote (65.87%) with (49.56%) in (74.76%) four (97.80%) six (46.07%) he (45.31%) told (57.37%) not (99.76%) to (99.76%) worry. (99.90%) And (98.44%) this (75.00%) leaves (50.44%) to (63.43%) my (99.32%) third (93.90%) file (88.72%) plan. (73.49%) And (86.47%) all (99.37%) circumstances (100.00%) are (65.92%) sponsor (19.69%) to (58.30%) burden (71.00%) should (65.87%) be (99.46%) to (51.56%) go (98.44%) to (85.84%) go (21.31%) prayer. (99.51%) God (92.04%) is (84.77%) the (95.17%) one (80.37%) who's (63.57%) in (96.68%) control (99.07%) to (93.12%) all (99.51%) knowing (99.46%) what, (76.56%) Worry (94.34%) is (47.95%) for (70.17%) getting (62.30%) god (50.68%) ten (7.76%) everything. (99.80%) I'm (92.33%) taking (99.22%) things (99.71%) into (98.19%) our (99.46%) own (99.85%) hands. (79.98%) One (92.82%) academic (99.85%) journal (96.53%) that (99.17%) I (98.19%) came (99.32%) across (99.56%) in (31.91%) my (99.22%) research (100.00%) claimed (74.12%) worry (90.82%) because (63.28%) reinforced (91.02%) as (99.80%) feared (92.68%) outcomes (98.29%) rarely (99.76%) come (99.46%) to (92.92%) be (96.92%) thus (86.33%) providing (99.37%) the (97.17%) illusion (99.61%) that (99.61%) worries (53.66%) successfully (99.85%) ever (60.30%) a (89.84%) catastrophe. (99.90%) Thus (96.73%) worry (84.81%) is (41.46%) a (65.82%) strategy (60.55%) set (89.89%) developed (63.28%) and (60.94%) response (99.37%) to (54.88%) anxiety (99.95%) over (98.63%) uncontrolled (79.39%) outcomes (99.71%) and (99.61%) reinforces (84.38%) itself (99.61%) over (87.26%) time. (97.07%) They (99.22%) identify (85.40%) worry (95.31%) Either (56.25%) to (34.81%) haven't (67.48%) created (81.20%) in (53.86%) order (99.46%) to (99.07%) see (82.47%) ourselves (97.95%) things (29.86%) we're (50.05%) actually (96.29%) in (91.89%) our (99.02%) control. (99.27%) Facing (49.37%) burdens (38.04%) that (97.27%) would (69.43%) normally (98.00%) worry (96.58%) us, (76.61%) but (93.95%) seeking (91.75%) on (36.40%) prayer, (91.80%) and (98.10%) it's... (78.81%) That (78.61%) life (39.28%) and (62.21%) perfect (64.60%) road (21.08%) is (96.09%) hard. (99.02%) But (99.95%) it (98.83%) does (91.89%) not (99.85%) deny (99.61%) our (92.87%) faith (96.48%) in (52.73%) god's (99.32%) power. (97.80%) Paul (56.05%) just (56.84%) one (98.34%) of (87.89%) the (88.33%) main (54.35%) set (47.66%) an (98.58%) example (99.76%) of (99.66%) trusting (94.14%) god (92.43%) in (81.93%) hard (99.46%) time. (58.20%) Example (64.79%) shows (93.46%) that (95.51%) God (50.05%) score (35.52%) when (82.81%) we (98.97%) do (99.90%) not (99.95%) worry. (99.12%) God (98.63%) is (89.94%) glorified (76.03%) verified (52.78%) by (92.33%) all (62.99%) beauty (26.98%) to (81.10%) his (97.17%) commands, (52.98%) which (90.38%) is (84.23%) the (50.20%) key (99.80%) issue. (99.66%) To (47.05%) why (79.59%) wearing (78.86%) is (50.44%) not. (99.90%) So (97.71%) In (76.76%) summary. (97.56%) Don't (99.95%) worry. (99.90%) Me (84.67%) happy. (99.76%)
