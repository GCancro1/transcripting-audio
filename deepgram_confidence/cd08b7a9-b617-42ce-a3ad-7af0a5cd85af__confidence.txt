Total Confidence:  (91.80%)

We (73.39%) have (94.38%) so (93.16%) many (96.39%) great (99.27%) musicians (96.92%) among (93.21%) us, (95.85%) but (96.78%) none (99.95%) of (99.85%) these (99.90%) are (97.36%) as (99.66%) influential (97.56%) as (98.54%) Bowie. (70.95%) We (99.27%) look (97.90%) at (99.27%) is (73.34%) like, (98.39%) kanye (88.43%) West, (40.99%) madonna (36.35%) Lady (94.97%) gaga (99.95%) was (21.84%) timberlake (63.48%) like, (34.38%) i (23.78%) think (84.18%) well. (32.59%) These (53.03%) guys (89.01%) are (79.98%) great. (96.97%) But (95.70%) in (76.42%) reality, (96.53%) it (99.61%) all (95.31%) goes (99.90%) back (98.63%) to (97.41%) one (99.27%) guy, (99.41%) and (98.83%) that (98.97%) is (98.78%) great (50.20%) david (97.95%) bowie (67.68%) influence. (98.29%) He (83.35%) has (87.94%) a (76.90%) great (41.82%) influence (95.36%) on (76.61%) any (55.32%) great (95.12%) musicians (67.97%) today. (99.66%) He (99.12%) is (45.90%) an (86.96%) icon (99.12%) when (99.95%) it (78.32%) comes (99.85%) to (99.71%) fashion (99.90%) as (99.71%) well (99.32%) as (99.80%) an (91.50%) icon (93.60%) regards (22.38%) music. (99.22%) So (98.97%) let's (90.38%) get (74.76%) started. (97.31%) David (47.36%) so (99.17%) many (99.51%) great (98.44%) musicians (99.32%) and (62.11%) that (83.45%) music. (99.76%) Let's (97.12%) start (99.22%) by (99.95%) saying (99.76%) Kanye (94.53%) West, (98.00%) not (74.51%) only (99.27%) was (96.97%) predicted (99.46%) by (99.61%) david (60.84%) Bowie (99.27%) to (96.00%) be (99.12%) a (99.56%) very (99.22%) successful (100.00%) musician, (99.95%) but (98.73%) Kinda (62.35%) was. (70.70%) Was (69.78%) the (94.38%) first (98.24%) two. (95.80%) What (31.74%) he (97.61%) died. (96.44%) As (99.46%) well (98.49%) as (98.39%) says (95.17%) that (93.16%) ago (27.44%) was (84.96%) one (97.75%) of (91.26%) those (87.79%) inventories (30.05%) on (83.94%) his (97.56%) career. (97.90%) Really (39.89%) interview. (63.48%) That (83.01%) not (97.02%) only (83.74%) least (62.30%) influences (99.56%) his (82.96%) music, (99.95%) but (99.71%) also (96.73%) action (43.16%) and (93.65%) just (97.56%) audacity (99.27%) in (88.13%) general. (98.73%) So (98.97%) another (99.90%) example (99.90%) is (99.66%) Madonna. (83.11%) We (91.36%) see (90.19%) madonna (18.92%) influence (97.46%) of (92.24%) bo (21.06%) through (97.85%) fashion (99.90%) as (99.90%) well (97.95%) as (99.32%) Charisma (94.73%) and (99.37%) just (98.78%) being (99.07%) a (95.56%) pretty (99.12%) ridiculous (100.00%) person (91.02%) in (80.91%) general. (99.02%) And (48.10%) is (52.10%) something (86.28%) that (96.68%) was (97.02%) really (94.78%) never (99.95%) seen (99.66%) before. (99.90%) You. (23.39%) And (96.24%) because (99.71%) he's (65.04%) started (94.19%) doing (99.22%) those. (55.57%) So (97.90%) just (93.41%) heard (57.42%) everything. (95.07%) A (99.71%) lot (99.85%) of (95.51%) musicians (98.97%) really (99.02%) started (77.00%) seeing (45.65%) that (62.70%) as (54.15%) well. (90.67%) So (94.09%) now (97.17%) you (90.38%) know (77.73%) look (47.85%) at (72.95%) the (99.51%) musician (85.11%) inside (29.22%) as (81.40%) blue. (42.65%) Let's (99.12%) talk (98.97%) about (98.88%) cash. (42.24%) But (91.80%) we (74.56%) have (41.87%) a (99.32%) huge (99.95%) name (84.86%) in (83.84%) the (71.53%) fashion (92.97%) industry. (99.51%) Starting (99.66%) with (99.80%) this (63.77%) guy (22.79%) seems (58.01%) as (54.30%) so (37.13%) started (20.21%) valley (14.01%) the (64.79%) way (54.25%) up (66.21%) too. (62.65%) His (60.21%) black (91.80%) star (54.79%) open (47.36%) when (95.56%) he (96.97%) depicted (97.85%) as, (49.73%) like (97.51%) his (80.81%) mummy (25.44%) figure, (96.34%) but (99.07%) he (46.92%) people (99.41%) really (99.07%) did, (79.39%) I (99.07%) guess. (97.80%) I'm (93.75%) not (86.91%) really (96.24%) see (18.18%) password. (41.55%) But (91.75%) Probably (29.86%) has (98.78%) worked (99.51%) with (99.90%) many (99.76%) different (96.00%) designers, (99.80%) which (99.51%) has (99.51%) led (70.85%) him (99.46%) to (98.44%) be (57.08%) becoming (96.78%) such (97.17%) as (94.78%) successful (99.90%) in (92.53%) the (68.41%) fashion (99.95%) industry (99.76%) and (58.25%) and (95.51%) has (99.37%) been (98.93%) claimed (94.92%) by (99.41%) forbes (70.41%) C (43.95%) vaccine (43.73%) Sense. (61.57%) That's (37.33%) it (46.66%) very (78.03%) influential. (91.80%) French (13.75%) stuff. (57.08%) And (98.73%) he's (57.62%) greatly (99.95%) influenced (84.23%) fashion (97.31%) to (84.77%) where (99.51%) it (78.96%) has (98.10%) become (98.19%) today (97.90%) So (96.92%) let's (98.00%) take (99.61%) a (99.95%) look (100.00%) at (99.90%) lady (47.44%) gaga (75.05%) class (53.76%) of (22.51%) the (41.99%) Super (96.78%) bowl (71.78%) as (99.22%) well (98.83%) as (99.80%) different (99.76%) costumes, (93.90%) including (99.71%) Beyonce (58.11%) and (97.80%) many (99.80%) others. (99.80%) So (88.09%) Clearly, (99.56%) david, (98.24%) bowie (91.36%) is (66.31%) picking (31.54%) the (73.83%) fashion (99.02%) industry. (98.93%) And (98.29%) then (59.38%) now (95.80%) that (94.73%) you (98.68%) know (98.14%) that (86.77%) let's (96.92%) talk (97.17%) about (99.76%) as (57.08%) music (99.37%) But (44.04%) like (26.10%) it's (63.23%) really (98.19%) what (96.88%) he's (99.12%) known (99.66%) for. (97.75%) Obviously, (99.32%) he's (88.04%) a (77.78%) musician, (99.85%) but (99.41%) as (95.70%) a (65.87%) musician (78.81%) since (19.23%) as (88.13%) an (32.23%) artist (68.12%) as (99.41%) well. (98.63%) So (58.59%) always (14.25%) his (55.18%) music (99.51%) is (88.72%) what (96.53%) he's (98.63%) remembered (86.96%) for. (98.73%) He's (81.45%) has (97.75%) four (98.93%) records (99.90%) that (94.09%) should (59.86%) top (33.89%) in (94.82%) sales, (99.66%) including (98.88%) the (87.79%) low (96.44%) album. (81.30%) So (15.84%) start (69.14%) us (60.01%) and (35.23%) far (40.70%) as (57.03%) from (42.11%) Mars, (90.97%) the (95.51%) live (98.14%) album (98.83%) and (99.22%) the (98.24%) options (32.37%) to (41.02%) ashes (67.04%) off, (39.45%) which (99.17%) featured (53.56%) dash (67.14%) dash, (52.88%) the (80.13%) most (82.32%) killer (98.19%) baseline (99.27%) all (95.70%) time. (34.69%) So (62.99%) he (99.02%) has (99.32%) many (99.90%) songs (99.12%) that (90.82%) have (89.94%) been (98.00%) written (98.34%) in (54.79%) are (52.15%) greatly (97.56%) known. (99.41%) He's (98.29%) worked (99.80%) with (99.90%) some (99.90%) of (99.66%) the (92.04%) best (99.07%) musicians. (77.49%) Mick (68.12%) ja (21.17%) the (96.88%) queen... (99.07%) Whoever (75.39%) the (49.98%) fuck (86.91%) damn. (83.98%) He's (31.47%) written (98.44%) songs (91.41%) from (55.37%) my (38.01%) different (98.97%) genres. (99.85%) But (34.40%) we (95.85%) look (96.48%) at (99.32%) the... (98.58%) Like (40.21%) from (99.12%) sig (42.68%) started (42.41%) out. (39.60%) Compare (88.72%) that (99.32%) to (99.27%) the (99.41%) low (68.65%) we're (98.83%) gonna (85.60%) see (93.60%) a (98.05%) big (91.99%) difference (98.58%) in (73.14%) fun (87.74%) to (98.58%) rock (96.14%) and (94.48%) roll (98.78%) or (99.56%) if (95.85%) we (96.34%) compare (98.88%) zig (55.52%) started (27.88%) to (48.36%) sell (53.42%) to (68.41%) the (91.70%) access (60.69%) ashes (95.56%) out, (52.44%) We're (97.90%) just (91.75%) gonna (97.02%) see (99.22%) a (92.92%) massive (99.90%) difference (98.49%) in (97.85%) the (99.37%) fun. (54.79%) So (99.02%) looking (99.76%) at (99.85%) these (99.12%) reasons, (97.80%) it (99.02%) is (99.37%) to (98.88%) see (98.58%) how (99.46%) we (69.87%) have (53.27%) such (100.00%) an (97.46%) influential (99.85%) artist (88.87%) in (92.82%) the (97.75%) music (99.95%) industry. (99.95%) People (93.31%) give (72.36%) him (84.33%) so (99.80%) much (98.54%) credit (98.44%) for (83.98%) where (53.91%) he's (94.19%) done. (90.43%) He (90.62%) is (82.13%) a (80.52%) huge (41.89%) name (92.38%) and (68.85%) fashion, (99.51%) as (99.71%) well (99.41%) as (99.46%) a (93.55%) huge (99.56%) name (68.90%) of (72.71%) music. (99.90%) So (68.36%) Next (59.33%) time (88.28%) you're (71.92%) listening (99.27%) to (98.14%) a (95.95%) track (34.23%) think (45.24%) to (84.42%) yourself. (97.17%) Oh (31.93%) was (51.61%) probably (89.94%) the (99.71%) reason (99.80%) this (98.14%) person (99.95%) wrote (48.27%) this (96.58%) saw. (11.57%)
