Total Confidence:  (98.00%)

Hello, (90.23%) everyone. (96.04%) Today, (99.66%) I'm (98.00%) gonna (97.80%) be (98.97%) taking (54.15%) a (99.56%) little (99.61%) bit (98.24%) about (84.81%) why (58.30%) you (98.19%) should (81.35%) recycle. (65.43%) So (99.46%) I (98.78%) recycle (75.93%) at (95.02%) my (99.37%) house (99.66%) here (99.56%) in (99.66%) Columbus, (100.00%) and (99.46%) I (97.80%) try (83.94%) to (97.80%) do (50.73%) it (99.12%) as (99.76%) much (99.85%) as (99.95%) possible (100.00%) when (96.09%) I'm (98.29%) on (98.73%) campus, (99.76%) and (93.02%) I (98.78%) have (99.17%) any (98.29%) waste. (84.96%) So (99.56%) I'm (53.56%) talking (99.90%) about (99.85%) recycling, (99.95%) it (99.41%) brings (99.22%) up (98.00%) the (99.76%) issue (99.85%) of (99.51%) waste. (97.07%) And (98.49%) in (97.95%) the (99.71%) Us, (80.03%) most (99.95%) of (99.76%) our (99.90%) ways (66.55%) goes (97.85%) to (97.90%) landfills (98.24%) which (99.85%) is (99.76%) very (99.90%) problematic. (100.00%) So (98.93%) I'm (98.78%) gonna (94.63%) be (97.46%) talking (99.85%) a (99.17%) little (99.41%) bit (98.68%) about (99.90%) the (99.37%) issues (98.83%) of (99.51%) lentils (52.15%) why (55.86%) you (86.04%) should (98.63%) recycle (98.97%) and (97.80%) have (81.01%) this (53.76%) can (98.05%) replace (99.66%) the (97.07%) rentals (27.61%) and (99.07%) how (57.81%) to (86.08%) recycle. (96.48%) So (97.41%) first (99.95%) of (99.56%) all, (99.95%) landfills (88.43%) are (99.90%) very (99.85%) costly. (73.93%) On (98.63%) average, (98.73%) it (99.56%) costs (70.36%) thirty (99.95%) dollars (99.85%) to (96.73%) recycle (99.80%) trash, (99.80%) but (99.02%) it (99.56%) costs (74.66%) fifty (99.71%) dollars (97.07%) to (61.47%) send (98.49%) it (62.06%) to (98.49%) the (87.65%) landfill (60.64%) and (91.70%) even (99.85%) more (99.95%) expensive (83.45%) eighty (99.02%) dollars (99.51%) to (98.97%) inc (64.60%) it. (79.10%) And (79.35%) recyclable (99.80%) materials (99.66%) in (97.61%) the (99.46%) Us (74.71%) Waste (97.90%) stream (53.12%) would (96.04%) generate (99.85%) over (99.56%) seven (99.90%) billion (99.56%) dollars (99.85%) a (99.56%) year (99.85%) if (75.24%) they (93.31%) were (95.51%) a (56.59%) cycle (52.05%) instead. (99.61%) And (86.04%) not (97.95%) only (97.31%) this (85.50%) landfills (22.94%) those (34.35%) are (88.53%) very (79.49%) waste. (77.15%) So (98.58%) plastic (78.66%) bags (69.34%) some (23.50%) generate (51.42%) over (99.51%) three (99.80%) hundred (99.95%) thousand (99.22%) tons (92.38%) of (98.49%) rent (24.19%) waste (90.67%) on (82.67%) an (82.91%) annual (95.90%) basis. (99.80%) One (99.90%) third (99.32%) of (98.54%) the (99.90%) average (63.18%) down (62.94%) is (99.17%) sol (47.36%) packing (66.21%) material, (99.12%) and (99.66%) the (99.80%) United (98.97%) States (99.85%) currently (99.66%) recycles (65.72%) only (99.66%) thirty (100.00%) two (99.85%) percent (99.90%) of (99.85%) its (89.31%) waist. (75.49%) This (98.73%) is (97.12%) Retrieved (98.88%) from (99.32%) d (46.24%) y (38.72%) u (39.79%) University. (99.51%) So (99.37%) why (95.85%) you (96.68%) should (99.71%) recycle, (92.68%) like (99.17%) I (99.80%) said, (99.61%) is (76.86%) the (59.42%) one (93.60%) need (85.94%) or (56.93%) landfills (93.46%) and (98.54%) inc, (70.07%) but (99.37%) it (99.51%) also (99.85%) brings (91.89%) about (57.57%) many (99.46%) conservation (99.17%) in (40.50%) the (68.07%) benefits. (59.42%) So (98.73%) in (97.02%) coming (77.34%) down (96.88%) with (39.38%) trees, (98.68%) your (50.00%) considering (86.18%) wildlife (66.50%) habitat, (95.61%) You're (88.72%) also (98.34%) pursuing (67.24%) water (99.02%) sources (98.73%) and (99.66%) non (99.51%) renewable (93.21%) mineral (98.83%) sources. (56.49%) They (26.17%) also (99.37%) produce (63.23%) reducing (97.27%) pollution (99.32%) and (97.90%) reversing (96.53%) climate (100.00%) change. (99.51%) But (58.50%) recycling (99.90%) also (99.56%) comes (99.07%) with (57.57%) second (29.57%) economic (56.25%) benefit. (79.88%) So (98.19%) lowers (97.27%) the (99.46%) cost (95.85%) of (91.70%) energy (76.07%) to (99.41%) run (99.66%) land (71.44%) inc. (86.52%) And (99.17%) in (98.44%) a (98.83%) recycling (99.95%) economic (95.46%) information (94.43%) study (99.95%) conducted (99.95%) by (99.80%) the (99.85%) environmental (99.90%) protection (99.85%) agency, (99.90%) It (98.58%) was (99.61%) noted (98.54%) that (98.93%) seven (99.85%) hundred (100.00%) and (99.95%) fifty (99.90%) seven (99.85%) thousand (99.90%) jobs, (99.90%) thirty (100.00%) six (86.18%) point (98.63%) six (97.80%) billion (99.32%) dollars (99.90%) in (75.59%) wages (100.00%) and (99.51%) six (99.85%) point (98.68%) seven (99.17%) billion (99.95%) dollars (99.95%) in (92.77%) tax (99.51%) revenue (99.56%) were (37.67%) created (97.22%) just (99.85%) from (99.66%) recycling (99.27%) based (93.46%) activities (99.85%) in (99.46%) one (99.85%) year. (98.88%) So (99.17%) that (99.32%) shows (98.39%) just (99.71%) how (99.95%) important (99.07%) of (88.82%) an (95.75%) operation (98.93%) it (99.66%) is. (100.00%) So (99.22%) a (49.85%) common (80.66%) misconception (76.90%) is (63.48%) about (99.37%) recycling. (99.71%) Well (85.55%) okay. (96.97%) It (97.75%) takes (98.63%) too (75.93%) much (98.29%) time. (99.41%) It's (45.87%) just (98.10%) an (98.29%) inconvenient (93.21%) thing (99.66%) to (99.76%) do. (98.83%) Really (24.57%) not. (97.36%) As (99.66%) long (100.00%) as (99.95%) you're (98.54%) a (98.10%) Columbus (98.78%) city (92.33%) resident, (97.80%) and (91.50%) you (96.83%) live (94.97%) in (99.17%) a (99.85%) single (99.85%) family (100.00%) home (99.95%) or (99.56%) apartment (99.17%) that (99.46%) uses (99.46%) city (96.34%) of (88.72%) Columbus (97.56%) trash, (98.14%) you (80.91%) are (78.71%) able (99.71%) to (99.85%) be (99.90%) eligible (100.00%) for (99.85%) a (91.99%) recycling (98.78%) then. (78.81%) So (99.32%) you (99.56%) can (99.76%) just (99.76%) call (98.63%) the (99.71%) Columbus (99.76%) Department (99.76%) of (98.78%) public (99.90%) service. (99.07%) And (89.36%) it (38.16%) will (95.31%) help (58.84%) you (99.17%) up (78.17%) with (99.66%) a (99.22%) new (98.73%) pin (97.12%) that (99.32%) you (99.71%) can (99.56%) use (99.90%) and (98.24%) it's (78.03%) collected (99.22%) every (99.95%) two (98.93%) weeks. (99.90%) This (90.53%) is (97.17%) according (99.90%) to (99.90%) the (96.19%) Commerce (21.48%) public (95.36%) service (79.83%) website. (99.02%) And (97.07%) items (99.37%) that (98.58%) you (99.85%) can (99.61%) recycle. (99.61%) I'm (74.07%) sure (93.02%) miss (43.04%) you (91.85%) aware (100.00%) of (99.61%) these, (96.83%) but (99.51%) you (54.05%) some (98.39%) particularly (82.13%) important (99.90%) ones (98.78%) because (99.71%) they're (97.56%) so (98.24%) common (99.12%) And (36.79%) this (94.82%) includes (99.71%) aluminum, (98.97%) hands, (38.55%) plastic (99.66%) bottles. (98.10%) We (57.03%) can (95.95%) use (99.17%) now (26.20%) instead (95.65%) to (60.89%) one (73.24%) ninety (74.22%) need (31.05%) for (91.50%) plastic (96.04%) bottles (53.91%) at (96.73%) all. (99.61%) Newspapers (61.62%) magazine (99.27%) paper. (99.51%) Everyone (98.88%) gets (99.46%) papers (98.68%) that (96.34%) they (98.83%) don't (99.51%) actually (99.41%) end (99.22%) up (99.46%) using (93.65%) and (98.93%) typically (99.66%) they (76.37%) just (69.68%) starting (68.46%) away. (93.80%) And (62.16%) steel (57.03%) cans (96.14%) and (68.41%) glass (54.88%) containers. (97.02%) And (93.65%) this (98.39%) is (97.31%) from (99.37%) the (99.32%) care (45.41%) two (58.01%) website. (99.22%) And (98.00%) so (98.24%) In (99.37%) conclusion, (99.76%) it's (98.10%) noted (99.76%) that (99.17%) lan (58.06%) are (71.63%) costly (99.80%) and (99.85%) wasteful. (99.95%) They (99.56%) are (99.22%) not (84.38%) necessary (97.27%) and (99.56%) recycling (99.76%) could (96.88%) easily (99.90%) replace (98.78%) them. (99.71%) The (70.65%) is (96.14%) not (99.61%) a (82.91%) renewable (88.28%) resource (98.93%) in (97.27%) itself. (99.71%) So (99.02%) if (98.97%) everyone (99.27%) did (98.05%) their (97.90%) part, (99.85%) it (99.32%) would (99.51%) be (99.85%) much (99.90%) better (100.00%) off (98.83%) for (99.66%) the (99.80%) future. (99.90%) And (56.88%) I (99.27%) hope (98.88%) this (99.80%) has (99.71%) motivated (99.80%) you (99.32%) to (99.71%) go (99.51%) out (98.29%) and (99.32%) recycle (98.29%) if (98.29%) you (99.12%) don't (99.46%) already. (97.66%) Thank (97.95%) you. (98.68%)
