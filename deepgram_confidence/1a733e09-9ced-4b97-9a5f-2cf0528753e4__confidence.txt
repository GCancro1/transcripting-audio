Total Confidence:  (98.54%)

Thank (98.88%) you, (97.80%) Ravi. (71.09%) The (98.93%) problem (99.71%) in (99.66%) many (95.31%) industrial (99.90%) settings (99.71%) is (99.66%) downtime. (97.27%) Downtime (99.27%) is (99.41%) catastrophic (99.80%) expensive. (99.95%) Costing (88.62%) twenty (99.95%) five (99.85%) thousand (99.85%) dollars (99.61%) a (98.83%) minute (95.80%) or (96.44%) one (99.76%) a (94.92%) half (97.27%) million (99.27%) dollars (99.56%) for (89.60%) every (100.00%) hour (99.85%) in (97.31%) the (99.02%) automotive (99.90%) industry (92.33%) alone. (95.17%) With (98.93%) the (98.88%) rise (67.14%) of (98.44%) automation, (99.95%) this (99.76%) will (99.32%) compound (99.66%) as (99.61%) more (99.17%) machines (99.80%) will (98.29%) set (98.24%) idle. (100.00%) Downtime (75.10%) can (82.03%) be (99.80%) looked (98.49%) at (94.73%) from (99.61%) two (99.80%) different (99.80%) angles. (99.85%) A (69.87%) machine (99.51%) and (74.27%) a (97.41%) worker. (97.66%) Machines, (97.95%) require (86.62%) maintenance (100.00%) and (98.05%) support (99.90%) from (97.12%) workers, (99.66%) and (96.48%) workers (99.61%) require (99.80%) notifications (99.17%) and (98.10%) communication (98.19%) from (99.56%) the (99.56%) machines. (97.66%) Machines (92.19%) there's (97.12%) a (99.27%) lot (99.90%) of (98.54%) companies (94.34%) solving (99.90%) the (99.76%) machines (50.98%) side (97.31%) of (99.56%) this (99.17%) by (93.90%) employing (97.51%) sensors, (99.61%) generating (72.61%) statistics (99.56%) and (98.54%) ultimately (100.00%) doing (99.71%) analytics (99.76%) to (99.32%) optimize (98.88%) maintenance. (100.00%) However, (99.46%) as (98.73%) fewer (99.51%) workers (99.46%) are (97.80%) maintaining (99.80%) more (99.90%) machines, (99.56%) the (99.17%) worker (93.85%) communication (98.93%) becomes (99.95%) critical. (99.95%) This (99.27%) is (99.46%) exactly (99.95%) what's (99.12%) happening (99.95%) at (55.62%) the (68.85%) state (99.90%) of (99.66%) the (99.27%) art (99.66%) fourth (45.75%) factory, (99.85%) where (84.33%) they (99.90%) have (98.73%) machines__?__ (99.37%) They're (80.18%) connected (96.29%) to (99.85%) a (99.61%) dashboard. (99.95%) A (97.12%) supervisor (100.00%) monitoring (99.56%) this (98.63%) dashboard, (99.90%) issues (94.04%) commands (97.61%) to (89.21%) their (98.63%) technicians. (99.66%) If (97.02%) at (98.63%) any (98.19%) point, (98.34%) the (99.56%) supervisor (98.10%) or (96.39%) the (99.02%) technician (99.95%) is (98.44%) distracted, (98.49%) or (94.04%) mis (87.74%) communicates. (46.78%) They (60.11%) can (98.58%) be (98.78%) many (98.44%) minutes (94.82%) in (35.99%) downtime (95.46%) lost. (92.38%) And (99.27%) this (99.71%) happens (98.49%) daily. (99.76%) Contributing (99.95%) to (99.41%) roughly (99.71%) thirty (99.90%) minutes (98.14%) of (99.27%) downtime (99.17%) for (98.78%) this (96.83%) factory (98.39%) per (53.56%) shift. (66.99%) Many (99.90%) companies (99.95%) we (99.27%) talk (57.96%) to (97.12%) have (97.27%) similar (99.95%) downtime (97.75%) scenarios. (99.80%) They (98.10%) want (99.90%) their (98.68%) workers (99.12%) to (99.32%) be (75.93%) informed (99.27%) faster (99.95%) and (99.46%) more (99.95%) accurately. (99.90%) Hello. (96.53%) I'm (98.97%) Will (72.02%) Maker, (65.77%) Ceo (89.26%) and (97.71%) founder (99.46%) of (99.90%) Uptime. (99.51%) Where (54.69%) we're (98.10%) building (99.76%) a (99.80%) smarter (98.34%) industrial (99.71%) communication (94.87%) platform. (99.85%) To (99.17%) inform (98.00%) workers (97.46%) faster (100.00%) and (99.85%) more (99.95%) effectively. (99.80%) Our (98.44%) solution (97.31%) is (68.36%) to (67.97%) employ (29.22%) smart (80.22%) glasses. (97.36%) To (99.66%) deliver (99.76%) notifications (99.37%) directly (99.90%) to (99.76%) a (55.08%) workers (86.43%) field (99.76%) of (98.19%) view, (87.84%) in (97.90%) a (84.72%) timely (100.00%) and (68.85%) accurate (99.85%) manner, (99.95%) In (99.90%) addition, (99.80%) we'll (74.12%) provide... (76.12%) Provide (99.46%) a (99.61%) voice (98.24%) driven (99.71%) communication (98.39%) platform. (98.05%) So (98.63%) workers (99.71%) can (99.90%) talk (99.41%) with (99.32%) one (99.61%) another (98.93%) in (86.87%) a (78.17%) similar (96.24%) manner (96.24%) to (92.19%) Walkie (99.95%) talkie. (98.44%) Initially, (98.39%) we (99.66%) can (99.76%) use (99.90%) off (99.71%) the (82.23%) shelf (99.22%) smart (99.51%) glasses, (99.95%) but (99.76%) eventually, (98.93%) we (98.44%) will (96.19%) build (99.22%) our (99.76%) own (99.71%) wearable. (98.14%) With (99.46%) the (91.75%) specific (99.85%) needs (99.51%) of (99.02%) industrial (99.41%) communication (98.29%) in (74.71%) mind. (96.04%) Within (99.95%) one (98.19%) month, (99.37%) our (99.76%) system (99.90%) would (98.39%) pay (99.76%) for (99.90%) itself (99.61%) at (98.05%) this (63.28%) factory. (99.66%) Over (97.90%) the (99.12%) course (99.95%) of (99.90%) a (81.35%) year, (99.90%) we'd (73.10%) return (88.53%) ten (99.61%) times (95.46%) the (96.09%) initial (99.61%) investment. (98.97%) Netting (96.97%) a (74.76%) savings (99.90%) of (95.61%) three (99.76%) million (99.41%) dollars (99.37%) for (99.07%) this (98.34%) one (99.12%) factory. (99.80%) By (99.95%) saving (99.95%) a (99.37%) modest (99.90%) half (99.80%) a (96.44%) minute (99.71%) of (99.12%) down (87.50%) per (78.56%) shift. (98.10%) Across (99.95%) the (99.85%) Us, (86.67%) there (72.36%) are (71.73%) thirty (74.27%) five (99.61%) hundred (99.90%) factories (98.19%) that (95.46%) can (67.38%) leverage (97.85%) the (99.95%) same (99.85%) technology. (99.76%) Putting (99.37%) us (99.80%) at (99.27%) a (96.29%) roughly (99.12%) ten (99.95%) billion (99.76%) dollar (96.73%) market (97.71%) across (98.93%) of (53.76%) savings (99.80%) across (97.56%) the. (99.41%) Us (85.45%) manufacturing (99.95%) area. (99.95%) And (98.88%) of (99.90%) course, (99.90%) manufacturing (99.37%) is (74.56%) not (99.95%) the (99.27%) only (99.80%) industry (97.27%) that (99.51%) suffers (99.17%) from (75.39%) downtime. (84.28%) Disruption (53.32%) in (86.96%) oil (100.00%) gas (100.00%) sectors, (99.46%) could (99.51%) definitely (99.80%) benefit (100.00%) from (99.80%) having (99.95%) more (99.85%) informed (99.56%) workers. (99.56%) Our (99.85%) team (99.76%) is (99.76%) uniquely (99.95%) poised (99.66%) to (98.39%) solve (99.90%) this (99.46%) problem. (99.80%) A (95.17%) little (99.76%) bit (91.85%) about (97.17%) myself. (99.76%) I (99.90%) grew (99.95%) up (99.95%) in (97.66%) detroit (98.54%) area. (99.51%) My (99.22%) family (99.37%) owned (66.50%) and (90.58%) operated (98.54%) an (74.90%) industrial (99.95%) computing (56.64%) company. (99.85%) I (99.41%) went (98.54%) on (85.89%) to (99.22%) get (99.66%) my (98.68%) Phd (99.46%) and (48.27%) physics (99.46%) culminating (98.68%) with (99.90%) a (53.61%) research (98.34%) career (83.84%) at (83.89%) Stanford, (96.48%) working (99.90%) on (98.93%) their (98.54%) billion (96.00%) dollar (99.66%) extra (36.21%) laser (99.22%) facility. (99.95%) This (99.46%) facility (99.80%) suffers (99.17%) a (99.90%) variety (100.00%) of (99.85%) downtime (56.10%) times. (48.75%) And (98.44%) this (99.17%) inspired (81.69%) me (99.61%) to (99.76%) look (99.56%) for (99.95%) solutions. (99.76%) My (99.80%) call (89.60%) founder, (91.55%) Michael (97.75%) is (99.22%) a (94.78%) Phd (78.66%) student (99.95%) electrical (96.97%) engineering (99.90%) from (99.95%) Stanford (97.71%) with (99.66%) a (94.34%) research (97.95%) focus (88.87%) in (79.35%) acoustics (99.66%) and (95.75%) Wearable (78.03%) technologies. (99.56%) Our (99.80%) domain (98.49%) advisor (48.41%) Bob (88.77%) has (99.85%) over (99.90%) forty (98.63%) years (98.34%) experience. (99.95%) In (99.85%) the (99.56%) advanced (87.84%) manufacturing (100.00%) area. (99.90%) He's (87.30%) set (93.51%) up (85.06%) and (94.82%) supervised (71.44%) numerous (99.95%) factories (99.07%) throughout (97.41%) his (97.27%) career. (93.55%) Between (99.85%) us, (99.95%) with (97.80%) the (96.78%) acoustic (51.71%) the (93.46%) optical, (99.90%) the (98.05%) acoustic (99.37%) and (98.54%) the (93.31%) industrial (99.80%) knowledge (99.80%) required (99.32%) to (99.80%) create (99.90%) a (99.51%) new (99.95%) industrial (98.88%) communication (81.93%) system. (99.61%) To (99.80%) make (99.95%) a (99.32%) more (99.76%) informed (98.44%) reality (99.41%) for (99.07%) workers. (99.71%) If (99.27%) you (99.32%) believe (99.71%) in (96.48%) our (99.61%) more (95.80%) informed (82.62%) reality, (93.51%) please (99.32%) come (77.29%) contact (96.92%) talk (55.96%) us. (97.31%) Thank (97.80%) you. (98.49%)
