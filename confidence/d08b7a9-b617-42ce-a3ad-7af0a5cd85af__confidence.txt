	Speaker 0: We (97.00%) have (99.00%) so (99.00%) many (99.00%) great (99.00%) musicians (100.00%) among (99.00%) us (100.00%), but (97.00%) none (100.00%) of (100.00%) these (100.00%) are (100.00%) as (100.00%) influential (100.00%) as (100.00%) bow (96.00%). We (100.00%) look (100.00%) at (99.00%) these (38.00%) like (95.00%) Kanye (93.00%) west (13.00%) Madonna (95.00%) lady (96.00%) Gaga (82.00%), listen (74.00%) to (84.00%) him (72.00%) like (43.00%) we (37.00%) think (95.00%), wow (96.00%), these (94.00%) guys (98.00%) are (99.00%) great (100.00%), but (99.00%) in (100.00%) reality (100.00%), it (68.00%) all (100.00%) goes (100.00%) back (100.00%) to (100.00%) one (99.00%) guy (100.00%). And (100.00%) that (99.00%) is (99.00%) the (89.00%) great (98.00%) David (59.00%) bow (90.00%) influence (99.00%). He (99.00%) has (99.00%) a (98.00%) great (100.00%) influence (99.00%) on (98.00%) many (99.00%) great (99.00%) musicians (100.00%) today (100.00%). Um (87.00%), he (100.00%) is (93.00%) an (99.00%) icon (100.00%) when (100.00%) it (95.00%) comes (100.00%) to (100.00%) fashion (100.00%), as (100.00%) well (100.00%) as (99.00%) an (98.00%) icon (100.00%) when (99.00%) it (97.00%) comes (99.00%) to (99.00%) music (99.00%). So (98.00%) let's (96.00%) get (98.00%) started (99.00%). David (94.00%) Bowie (96.00%) influenced (100.00%) so (98.00%) many (100.00%) great (98.00%), uh (72.00%), musicians (100.00%) and (100.00%) their (96.00%) music (100.00%). Let's (97.00%) start (100.00%) by (100.00%) saying (100.00%), uh (83.00%), Kanye (76.00%) west (99.00%) not (99.00%) only (100.00%) was (100.00%) predicted (100.00%) by (100.00%) David (99.00%) Bowie (99.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) a (99.00%) very (100.00%) successful (100.00%) musician (100.00%), but (100.00%) Kanye (65.00%) west (99.00%) was (100.00%) the (99.00%) first (99.00%) to (74.00%) think (62.00%) David (82.00%) bow (98.00%) first (77.00%) when (90.00%) he (88.00%) died (92.00%), as (98.00%) well (99.00%) as (95.00%) it (56.00%) says (80.00%) that (97.00%) David (94.00%) Bowie (94.00%) was (96.00%) one (93.00%) of (93.00%) the (72.00%) most (81.00%) influe (99.00%) on (69.00%) his (99.00%) career (99.00%) in (50.00%) a (74.00%) rolling (84.00%) stones (97.00%) interview (99.00%) that (84.00%) not (99.00%) only (98.00%), uh (70.00%), influences (100.00%) his (98.00%) music (100.00%), but (100.00%) also (100.00%) fashion (100.00%) and (98.00%) just (98.00%) audacity (100.00%) in (100.00%) general (100.00%). So (99.00%) another (100.00%) example (100.00%) is (99.00%), uh (79.00%), Madonna (97.00%). We (99.00%) see (100.00%) Madonna's (96.00%) of (91.00%) bow (95.00%) through (99.00%) fashion (100.00%), as (100.00%) well (99.00%) as (99.00%) charisma (100.00%) and (100.00%) just (100.00%) being (100.00%) a (99.00%) pretty (99.00%) ridiculous (100.00%) person (100.00%) in (100.00%) general (99.00%). 

	Speaker 0: This (94.00%) was (93.00%) something (99.00%) that (98.00%) was (98.00%) really (96.00%) never (98.00%) seen (97.00%) before (100.00%) David (92.00%) Bowie (83.00%) and (99.00%) because (93.00%) he (95.00%) started (95.00%) doing (98.00%) those (56.00%) things (21.00%) was (72.00%) so (93.00%) just (97.00%) ballsy (92.00%) about (99.00%) everything (99.00%). A (100.00%) lot (100.00%) of (99.00%) musicians (100.00%) really (99.00%) started (92.00%) doing (98.00%) that (99.00%) as (100.00%) well (100.00%). So (100.00%) now (99.00%), you (100.00%) know (100.00%), a (99.00%) little (100.00%) bit (96.00%) about (97.00%) the (100.00%), uh (77.00%), musicians (100.00%) that (98.00%) David (99.00%) P (22.00%) has (99.00%) influenced (98.00%). Let's (100.00%) talk (100.00%) about (100.00%) fashion (99.00%). Bowie (89.00%) has (99.00%) a (100.00%) huge (100.00%) name (99.00%) in (99.00%) the (99.00%) fashion (100.00%) industry (100.00%), starting (100.00%) with (100.00%) his (97.00%) costumes (100.00%) as (97.00%), uh (46.00%), like (10.00%) star (56.00%) going (99.00%) all (99.00%) the (56.00%) way (99.00%) up (99.00%) to (75.00%), um (97.00%), his (95.00%) black (100.00%) star (92.00%) album (100.00%) when (99.00%) he's (99.00%) depicted (100.00%) as (98.00%) like (97.00%) his (70.00%) mummy (82.00%) figure (99.00%). But (99.00%) people (50.00%), people (94.00%) really (99.00%) dig (76.00%) it (98.00%), I (100.00%) guess (100.00%) I'm (100.00%) not (99.00%) really (99.00%) doing (47.00%) <inaudible> (27.00%), but (98.00%), um (83.00%), though (62.00%) he (44.00%) has (98.00%) worked (99.00%) with (100.00%) many (100.00%) different (99.00%) designers (100.00%), which (100.00%) has (100.00%) led (92.00%) him (100.00%) to (99.00%) becoming (97.00%) such (100.00%) a (94.00%) successful (100.00%), uh (65.00%), in (73.00%) a (70.00%) fashion (100.00%) industry (100.00%), uh (78.00%), and (93.00%) has (99.00%) been (100.00%) claimed (96.00%) by (100.00%) Forbes (99.00%), GQ (94.00%) magazine (99.00%) and (97.00%) rolling (98.00%) stones (92.00%) as (61.00%) a (49.00%) very (96.00%) influential (95.00%), uh (77.00%) fashionist (70.00%) uh (52.00%), and (99.00%) he's (98.00%) greatly (100.00%) influenced (100.00%) fashion (100.00%) to (99.00%) where (99.00%) it (92.00%) has (99.00%) become (98.00%) today (99.00%). So (100.00%) let's (100.00%) take (99.00%) a (100.00%) look (100.00%) at (100.00%), uh (57.00%), lady (72.00%) Argo's (73.00%) costumes (85.00%) of (92.00%) the (93.00%) super (63.00%) bowl (62.00%), as (100.00%) well (100.00%) as (70.00%) different (99.00%) costumes (100.00%), including (100.00%) Beyonces (98.00%) and (100.00%) many (99.00%) others (100.00%). So (99.00%) clearly (100.00%) David (98.00%) Bowie (97.00%) is (98.00%) big (73.00%) in (87.00%) the (92.00%) fashion (95.00%) industry (100.00%). And (96.00%) now (99.00%) that (99.00%) you (98.00%) know (98.00%) that (97.00%) let's (99.00%) talk (99.00%) about (100.00%) his (98.00%) music (100.00%), Bowie's (95.00%) 

	Speaker 1: Music (100.00%) is (99.00%) really (99.00%) what (99.00%) he's (100.00%) known (100.00%) for (100.00%). Obviously (100.00%) he's (100.00%) a (100.00%) musician (100.00%), but (100.00%) as (100.00%) a (98.00%) musician (100.00%), he (100.00%) search (15.00%) as (88.00%) an (99.00%) artist (100.00%) as (100.00%) well (100.00%). So (95.00%) Bo's (96.00%) music (100.00%), uh (72.00%), is (99.00%) what (100.00%) he's (100.00%) remembered (100.00%) for (99.00%) he's (99.00%) has (97.00%) four (99.00%) records (99.00%) that (96.00%) reached (99.00%) a (61.00%) top (95.00%) in (77.00%) sales (82.00%), including (100.00%) the (100.00%) low (99.00%) album (100.00%), like (55.00%) he (48.00%) star (62.00%) us (37.00%) in (41.00%) this (45.00%) inspires (73.00%) as (46.00%) the (96.00%) live (98.00%) album (99.00%) and (100.00%) the (99.00%) ashes (97.00%) to (94.00%) ashes (98.00%) album (99.00%), which (100.00%) featured (100.00%) ashes (97.00%) to (90.00%) ashes (99.00%) the (100.00%) most (100.00%) killer (100.00%) baseline (89.00%) of (100.00%) all (99.00%) time (99.00%). So (99.00%), um (90.00%), he (100.00%) has (100.00%) many (100.00%) songs (100.00%) that (100.00%) have (98.00%) been (99.00%) written (100.00%) in (82.00%), are (89.00%) greatly (99.00%) known (97.00%). He's (100.00%) worked (100.00%) with (100.00%) some (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (97.00%) best (100.00%) musicians (100.00%), MC (69.00%) Jagger (95.00%), um (87.00%), uh (88.00%), the (100.00%) queen (100.00%), whoever (99.00%) the (80.00%) fuck (98.00%) that (34.00%) is (90.00%) damnit (67.00%). Um (90.00%), he (97.00%) has (94.00%) written (100.00%) songs (100.00%) for (63.00%) many (97.00%) different (100.00%) genres (100.00%). So (89.00%) if (90.00%) we (94.00%) look (99.00%) at (100.00%) the (99.00%) Ziggy (87.00%) from (98.00%) Ziggy (83.00%) star (65.00%) ass (54.00%) album (99.00%) and (90.00%) compare (99.00%) that (99.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) low (97.00%) album (100.00%), we're (99.00%) gonna (97.00%) see (99.00%) a (52.00%) big (83.00%) difference (98.00%) in (97.00%) funk (99.00%) to (99.00%) rock (99.00%) and (73.00%) roll (99.00%). Or (100.00%) if (97.00%) we (98.00%), we (69.00%) compare (98.00%) the (42.00%) Zuki (55.00%) star (46.00%) to (37.00%) album (100.00%), to (97.00%) the (99.00%), uh (63.00%), ashes (96.00%) ashes (94.00%) album (99.00%), we're (100.00%) just (99.00%) gonna (97.00%) see (100.00%) a (99.00%) massive (100.00%) difference (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) funkiness (100.00%). So (100.00%) looking (100.00%) at (100.00%) these (99.00%) reasons (100.00%), it (100.00%) is (98.00%) clear (99.00%) to (100.00%) see (99.00%) how (94.00%) Bo (19.00%) is (87.00%) such (100.00%) an (99.00%) influential (100.00%) artist (99.00%) in (98.00%) the (100.00%) music (100.00%) industry (100.00%). People (100.00%) give (99.00%) him (99.00%) so (100.00%) much (100.00%) credit (100.00%) for (100.00%) what (100.00%) he's (100.00%) done (99.00%). He (100.00%) is (90.00%) a (100.00%) huge (100.00%) name (98.00%) fashion (41.00%) as (99.00%) well (98.00%) as (97.00%) a (96.00%) huge (98.00%) name (95.00%) of (75.00%) music (100.00%). So (99.00%) next (99.00%) time (97.00%) you're (99.00%) listening (99.00%) to (99.00%) a (99.00%) hot (86.00%) track (84.00%) think (76.00%) to (98.00%) yourself (99.00%), but (74.00%) we (56.00%) was (88.00%) probably (98.00%) the (96.00%) reason (97.00%) this (97.00%) person (98.00%) read (59.00%) this (88.00%) song (91.00%).
