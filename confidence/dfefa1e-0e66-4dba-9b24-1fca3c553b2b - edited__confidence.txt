	Speaker 0: Hi (97.00%), I'm (99.00%), uh (79.00%), Paul (33.00%) comas (39.00%). I (100.00%) run (99.00%) a (100.00%) group (100.00%) called (99.00%) the (97.00%) 18th (97.00%). We (100.00%) are (98.00%) basically (100.00%) animation (100.00%) technology (100.00%) and (100.00%) research (100.00%) team (71.00%). So (100.00%), um (95.00%), I'm (100.00%) helping (100.00%) Phil (76.00%) void (77.00%), which (99.00%) I (100.00%) think (100.00%), uh (88.00%), hasn't (100.00%) been (100.00%) properly (100.00%) addressed (100.00%) in (100.00%) our (99.00%) organization (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (100.00%), um (78.00%), she (82.00%) is (99.00%) responsible (100.00%) for (100.00%) doing (100.00%), uh (89.00%), research (100.00%) and (98.00%) learning (100.00%), uh (87.00%), far (96.00%) into (97.00%) the (100.00%) future (100.00%). We (86.00%) have (99.00%) frost (98.00%) by (43.00%) technology (100.00%) frost (97.00%) by (70.00%) animation (100.00%), which (100.00%) does (99.00%) a (99.00%) lot (100.00%) of (99.00%), uh (78.00%), um (76.00%), technology (100.00%) for (99.00%) the (100.00%) current (100.00%), but (60.00%) doesn't (100.00%) do (99.00%) so (100.00%) much (100.00%) forward (81.00%) thinking (82.00%). Doesn't (99.00%) do (99.00%) enough (100.00%) innovation (100.00%) that (99.00%) I (100.00%) believe (100.00%) they (99.00%) should (100.00%). And (100.00%) I (100.00%) am (98.00%) trying (100.00%) to (100.00%) help (99.00%) fill (98.00%) that (100.00%) void (100.00%) by (100.00%) creating (100.00%) technology (100.00%) for (98.00%) now (100.00%), but (100.00%) also (100.00%) for (99.00%) one (99.00%) to (99.00%) two (100.00%) years (100.00%) out (85.00%). So (99.00%) thinking (100.00%) about (100.00%) things (100.00%) that (99.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) do (100.00%) to (100.00%) improve (100.00%) the (100.00%) quality (100.00%) of (100.00%) animation (100.00%) in (98.00%) our (99.00%) game (69.00%) specific (53.00%) game (63.00%), play (50.00%) animation (98.00%). So (98.00%) this (99.00%) is (99.00%), um (80.00%), how (99.00%) do (99.00%) I (100.00%) make (100.00%) the (100.00%) player (99.00%) look (100.00%) and (100.00%) feel (100.00%), uh (86.00%), realistic (100.00%), believable (100.00%), responsive (100.00%). Um (92.00%), how (100.00%) do (99.00%) I (100.00%) do (100.00%) that (100.00%) in (100.00%) a (99.00%) way (100.00%) that (100.00%) doesn't (100.00%) make (100.00%) the (99.00%) workflow (87.00%) really (100.00%) problematic (100.00%) for (100.00%) the (100.00%) artists (83.00%)__?__ 

	Speaker 0: How (100.00%) do (100.00%) I (100.00%) do (100.00%) this (100.00%) in (100.00%) a (100.00%) way (100.00%) that (100.00%) is (99.00%), uh (82.00%), uh (77.00%), really (100.00%) easy (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%), but (99.00%) it (89.00%) creates (100.00%) powerful (100.00%) techniques (100.00%) that (99.00%) also (99.00%) scales (100.00%) us (83.00%) a (99.00%) bunch (100.00%) of (99.00%) different (100.00%) games (99.00%). So (100.00%) we (96.00%) have (89.00%) games (99.00%) like (100.00%) FIFA (95.00%), you (97.00%) know (97.00%), they're (96.00%) very (99.00%) animation (100.00%) driven (61.00%) games (88.00%). There (46.00%), there (57.00%) need (94.00%) to (100.00%) have (99.00%) a (99.00%) certain (100.00%) style (98.00%) of (72.00%), of (81.00%) movement (98.00%) with (70.00%) games (99.00%) like (100.00%), uh (83.00%), like (89.00%) battlefield (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (99.00%) much (100.00%) more (99.00%) multiplayer (98.00%) focused (83.00%), very (99.00%), very (99.00%), uh (78.00%), server (99.00%) driven (56.00%) animation (100.00%) system (47.00%). So (100.00%) it (99.00%) needs (99.00%) to (100.00%) be (99.00%) kind (99.00%) of (98.00%), you (92.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) handle (100.00%) a (86.00%) very (87.00%), uh (66.00%), wide (100.00%) variety (100.00%) of (63.00%) animation (100.00%) systems (88.00%). And (100.00%) then (99.00%) we (100.00%) also (100.00%) have (99.00%) games (99.00%) like (100.00%) dragon (91.00%) age (32.00%) and (97.00%), uh (83.00%), and (74.00%) Anthem (100.00%), which (99.00%) have (99.00%) crazy (100.00%) creatures (100.00%), multi (99.00%) limb (10.00%) things (99.00%) with (99.00%) like (96.00%) chairs (100.00%) that (99.00%) come (99.00%) to (99.00%) life (91.00%), like (96.00%) all (100.00%) sorts (100.00%) of (100.00%) very (99.00%) interesting (100.00%) and (99.00%) creative (100.00%) race (57.00%). And (73.00%) it's (91.00%) like (99.00%), how (100.00%) can (100.00%) I (100.00%) create (100.00%) systems (100.00%) to (99.00%) help (98.00%) animations (100.00%) in (85.00%) all (100.00%) these (100.00%) varieties (100.00%) of (99.00%) games (99.00%) do (99.00%) better (100.00%)__?__ So (99.00%) that (56.00%), that's (97.00%) my (97.00%), that's (98.00%) my (99.00%) goal (100.00%). I (100.00%) am (76.00%) trying (100.00%) to (100.00%) help (100.00%) animation (100.00%) do (99.00%) better (100.00%), um (88.00%), by (99.00%) improving (100.00%) quality (100.00%) through (100.00%) technology (100.00%). And (99.00%) I (99.00%) have (99.00%), uh (65.00%), three (78.00%) people (93.00%), two (95.00%), two (89.00%) engineers (100.00%), and (99.00%) one (100.00%), uh (77.00%), technical (100.00%) animator (100.00%), uh (83.00%), who (100.00%) are (56.00%) really (99.00%) engaged (100.00%) to (76.00%) help (75.00%) me (100.00%) do (99.00%) that (100.00%).

	Speaker 0: So (91.00%) it's (94.00%) actually (99.00%), it's (89.00%) a (99.00%) really (100.00%) easy (100.00%) metric (100.00%) for (100.00%) me (100.00%). Well (99.00%), it's (100.00%) not (100.00%) easy (100.00%). It's (83.00%), it's (94.00%) hard (100.00%) to (100.00%) say (100.00%) no (99.00%), but (99.00%) the (75.00%), the (93.00%) idea (100.00%) is (99.00%) I (100.00%) don't (100.00%) write (99.00%) the (100.00%) feature (99.00%) for (99.00%) you (83.00%) gain (51.00%). I (100.00%) write (99.00%) the (100.00%) technology (100.00%) that (100.00%) helps (99.00%) you (100.00%) write (99.00%) the (100.00%) feature (98.00%). And (100.00%) I (100.00%) also (100.00%) only (100.00%) write (99.00%) technology (100.00%) that (100.00%) I (100.00%) know (100.00%) can (100.00%) be (100.00%) used (100.00%) across (100.00%) multiple (100.00%) game (78.00%) teams (89.00%). And (100.00%) I (100.00%) can (100.00%) do (100.00%) this (100.00%) because (100.00%) I've (99.00%) have (41.00%) experience (100.00%). I (64.00%) I've (96.00%) worked (99.00%) with (99.00%) a (100.00%) bunch (100.00%) of (99.00%) different (99.00%) painting (52.00%). I (100.00%) know (100.00%) what (99.00%) their (85.00%), uh (75.00%), their (97.00%) systems (98.00%) are (100.00%). I (100.00%) know (100.00%) what (99.00%) they're (100.00%) looking (100.00%) for (100.00%). So (100.00%) it's (97.00%), it's (91.00%) about (100.00%) trying (100.00%) to (100.00%) help (100.00%) them (100.00%) solve (100.00%) problems (100.00%) that (99.00%) they (100.00%) have (100.00%), but (100.00%) doing (100.00%) it (99.00%) in (100.00%) a (100.00%) way (100.00%) that (99.00%) I (100.00%) know (99.00%) can (100.00%) help (100.00%) multiple (100.00%) teams (99.00%). And (99.00%) so (100.00%) how (100.00%) this (100.00%) helps (96.00%) me (98.00%) scale (100.00%) or (99.00%) not (100.00%) get (99.00%) overwhelmed (100.00%) by (99.00%) too (98.00%) much (99.00%) support (100.00%) is (100.00%), um (86.00%), creating (100.00%) sort (99.00%) of (99.00%) varied (64.00%) the (44.00%) find (100.00%), um (75.00%), blocks (98.00%) of (99.00%) technology (100.00%) that (100.00%) work (100.00%) within (100.00%) a (99.00%) certain (100.00%) scope (100.00%) and (100.00%) then (99.00%) allow (100.00%) the (100.00%) teams (99.00%) to (100.00%) put (100.00%) their (100.00%) own (100.00%) customizations (100.00%) in (99.00%), in (100.00%) a (100.00%) way (100.00%) that (100.00%) is (100.00%) not (100.00%), um (52.00%), dependent (99.00%) on (100.00%) me (100.00%). So (100.00%) if (53.00%) they (100.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) add (100.00%) context (82.00%) to (91.00%) say (100.00%) like (97.00%), Hey (98.00%), I (100.00%) want (62.00%) to (63.00%) do (99.00%), you (86.00%) know (86.00%), Aldo (73.00%) needs (67.00%) to (93.00%) behave (98.00%) in (95.00%) this (100.00%) way (100.00%). Uh (78.00%), I (100.00%) give (98.00%) them (100.00%) access (100.00%) or (95.00%) API (98.00%) or (100.00%) interface (100.00%) for (96.00%) them (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) able (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%) that (100.00%). Um (88.00%), with (96.00%) out (49.00%) asking (98.00%) me (98.00%), say (94.00%), Hey (98.00%), I (100.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (99.00%) this (100.00%). Well (25.00%), what (99.00%) do (100.00%) I (100.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) do (100.00%)__?__ 

	Speaker 2: So (91.00%) tell (97.00%) me (97.00%), what's (70.00%) the (80.00%) web (69.00%) clear (94.00%) boundaries (91.00%) of (36.00%) owner (24.00%) between (98.00%) ING (41.00%) code (98.00%) by (19.00%) your (70.00%) code (91.00%)__?__ 

	Speaker 0: I (95.00%) have (82.00%), I (88.00%) have (96.00%) a (98.00%) set (99.00%) of (99.00%) plugins (100.00%), um (49.00%), motion (99.00%) synthesis (98.00%), plugins (99.00%), it's (95.00%) an (95.00%) and (42.00%) plugins (99.00%), basically (100.00%) anything (100.00%) in (100.00%) that (100.00%) code (100.00%) base (84.00%). I (99.00%) own (91.00%), you (99.00%) give (92.00%) a (91.00%) problem (95.00%) with (99.00%) that (99.00%) code (100.00%). You (93.00%), you (93.00%) come (98.00%) to (99.00%) me (85.00%), you (84.00%), you (88.00%) wanna (88.00%) make (100.00%) changes (100.00%) in (96.00%) that (99.00%) code (66.00%). That's (100.00%) fine (100.00%). But (100.00%) come (100.00%) talk (100.00%) to (100.00%) me (100.00%) and (100.00%) we'll (100.00%) talk (100.00%) about (100.00%) how (100.00%) to (100.00%) make (100.00%) sure (100.00%) that (92.00%) we (99.00%) minimize (99.00%) divergence (100.00%). So (100.00%), uh (89.00%), any (100.00%) code (98.00%) that (100.00%) needs (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (89.00%) for (100.00%) a (99.00%) game (99.00%) I'll (72.00%), I'll (99.00%) add (100.00%) an (96.00%) interface (100.00%) or (94.00%) we'll (99.00%) talk (100.00%) about (100.00%) a (92.00%) ways (60.00%) to (99.00%) make (100.00%) sure (99.00%) that (95.00%) you (100.00%) can (99.00%) do (100.00%) it (99.00%), uh (52.00%), for (99.00%) frostbite (99.00%) side (40.00%), since (97.00%) it's (99.00%) a (99.00%) plugin (100.00%), I (100.00%) also (100.00%) need (99.00%) to (100.00%) make (100.00%) changes (100.00%) to (99.00%) frostbite (76.00%) occasionally (100.00%). So (99.00%) I (100.00%) work (98.00%) with (99.00%) the (50.00%) frostbite (96.00%) team (95.00%) to (86.00%) say (99.00%), Hey (98.00%), I (98.00%) need (100.00%) to (100.00%) open (100.00%) this (100.00%) up (100.00%) to (99.00%) allow (100.00%) me (99.00%) to (99.00%) do (98.00%) this (99.00%) thing (98.00%) or (100.00%) look (98.00%), uh (76.00%), my (96.00%), my (93.00%) plugins (100.00%) are (99.00%) exposing (100.00%) a (99.00%) bug (98.00%) in (95.00%) your (99.00%) code (99.00%). Can (100.00%) we (100.00%) work (100.00%) together (100.00%) to (98.00%) fix (100.00%) that (100.00%) thing (96.00%)__?__ So (99.00%), um (87.00%), it's (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) isolated (100.00%) in (99.00%) a (85.00%) sense (99.00%) of (75.00%) clear (100.00%) boundaries (99.00%) about (99.00%) what (100.00%) is (86.00%) mine (99.00%) versus (98.00%) what (100.00%) is (98.00%) frostbite (99.00%) and (100.00%) what (99.00%) this (57.00%) game (97.00%) takes (62.00%). 

	Speaker 2: So (81.00%) who's (97.00%) responsible (99.00%) for (87.00%) the (96.00%) quality (99.00%) of (98.00%) the (46.00%) product (99.00%). I (95.00%) didn't (98.00%) hear (83.00%) you (99.00%) mention (98.00%) anything (94.00%) for (35.00%) quality (95.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Uh (63.00%), I'm (98.00%) responsible (100.00%) and (99.00%) my (100.00%) team (100.00%) is (98.00%) responsible (100.00%). So (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) a (99.00%) very (99.00%).
