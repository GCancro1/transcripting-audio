So (100.00%) those (100.00%) are (98.00%) my (100.00%) extracurricular (100.00%) activities (100.00%) besides (100.00%) being (99.00%) an (92.00%) assessor (100.00%) for (100.00%) the (100.00%) township (100.00%).

	Speaker 0: Well (99.00%), I (100.00%) just (100.00%) wanted (97.00%), I (75.00%), I (90.00%) remember (100.00%) the (100.00%) last (100.00%) time (100.00%) I (100.00%) was (100.00%) here (99.00%), you (100.00%) mentioned (100.00%) that (100.00%) you (100.00%) had (99.00%) done (99.00%) a (98.00%) calculus (46.00%) and (75.00%) the (89.00%) farm (92.00%) was (94.00%) bringing (97.00%) in (91.00%) 20% (97.00%) of (99.00%) the (99.00%) family (100.00%) income (100.00%). So (100.00%) that's (100.00%) the (100.00%) farm (99.00%), uh (84.00%), Diane's (99.00%) part-time (100.00%) job (100.00%). And (100.00%) that (100.00%) would (100.00%) be (100.00%) the (100.00%) only (100.00%) other (99.00%) income (98.00%) as (55.00%) the (99.00%) assessor (99.00%). Yep (59.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Last (100.00%) year (100.00%) on (100.00%) this (99.00%) farm (100.00%), I (100.00%) do (100.00%) a (100.00%) pretty (100.00%) good (100.00%) job (100.00%) managing (100.00%) what (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) here (99.00%) for (100.00%) assets (100.00%) and (89.00%) what (100.00%) we (100.00%) have (100.00%) for (99.00%) milk (95.00%). We (100.00%) do (99.00%) pretty (37.00%) good (96.00%) as (100.00%) far (100.00%) as (99.00%), you (94.00%) know (95.00%), pounds (97.00%) of (98.00%) milk (99.00%) per (99.00%) gallon (86.00%) and (98.00%) so (100.00%) forth (99.00%). Mm-hmm (79.00%) <affirmative> (78.00%), but (100.00%) 2012 (100.00%), when (100.00%) I (100.00%) sat (59.00%) down (100.00%) and (100.00%) done (98.00%) all (100.00%) of (81.00%) the (96.00%) tax (100.00%) preparations (100.00%) and (100.00%) so (100.00%) forth (100.00%), the (100.00%) reality (100.00%) was (100.00%) I (100.00%) sold (100.00%) milk (99.00%) for (100.00%) seven (100.00%) months (100.00%) out (60.00%), 12 (100.00%) for (100.00%) less (99.00%) than (84.00%) cost (99.00%) of (97.00%) production (100.00%). That's (100.00%) because (100.00%) milk (99.00%) prices (100.00%) were (99.00%) sold (96.00%) deep (100.00%) pressed (78.00%), and (100.00%) I've (100.00%) never (100.00%) in (100.00%) my (100.00%) 35 (99.00%) years (100.00%) here (99.00%) on (98.00%) the (97.00%) farm (100.00%), as (99.00%) a (45.00%) proprietor (100.00%) have (100.00%) seen (99.00%) my (100.00%) expenses (100.00%) go (100.00%) up (100.00%) so (100.00%) fast (100.00%) and (89.00%) every (100.00%) aspect (100.00%) of (100.00%) what (100.00%) I (100.00%) purchase (87.00%) and (93.00%), and (83.00%) bring (100.00%) in (93.00%) to (99.00%) utilize (99.00%) on (99.00%) the (98.00%) farm (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Now (100.00%) that (100.00%) was (54.00%), is (93.00%) largely (100.00%) due (99.00%) to (100.00%) the (100.00%) drought (100.00%) or (100.00%) other (100.00%) factors (100.00%) as (100.00%) well (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Fuel (100.00%) prices (100.00%). Everything (100.00%) related (100.00%) to (100.00%) fuel (100.00%) is (43.00%) gone (99.00%) astronomically (100.00%) high (100.00%). When (100.00%) we (100.00%) sat (41.00%) down (100.00%) and (100.00%) done (99.00%) the (93.00%) books (97.00%), my (100.00%) fuel (100.00%) expenses (99.00%) were (100.00%) over (100.00%) $6,000 (99.00%) greater (100.00%) this (100.00%) year (100.00%) than (74.00%) they (99.00%) were (100.00%) in (96.00%) 2011 (55.00%).
