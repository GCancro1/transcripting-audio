No (100.00%) matter (100.00%) what (100.00%) I (100.00%), you (97.00%) guys (89.00%) are (98.00%) going (95.00%) to (96.00%) believe (95.00%) in (96.00%) me (99.00%). Second (99.00%), as (100.00%) an (88.00%) international (100.00%) student (100.00%) from (100.00%) China (100.00%), I (100.00%) got (100.00%) a (100.00%) lot (100.00%) of (98.00%) question (100.00%) about (100.00%) what (99.00%) does (98.00%) the (99.00%) authentic (99.00%) Chinese (100.00%) food (91.00%) look (99.00%) like (99.00%). I (100.00%) only (89.00%) only (100.00%) have (99.00%) 20 (99.00%) seconds (99.00%) to (99.00%) explain (100.00%) it (98.00%) to (99.00%) them (99.00%), but (100.00%) today (100.00%) we (100.00%) will (54.00%) have (100.00%) three (99.00%) minutes (100.00%) to (99.00%) talk (99.00%) about (100.00%) it (99.00%). So (100.00%) lucky (67.00%) you (98.00%) guys (98.00%), as (99.00%) we (98.00%) all (99.00%) know (99.00%), China (100.00%) is (100.00%) a (99.00%) huge (100.00%) country (100.00%) with (100.00%) heavy (99.00%) population (100.00%). According (100.00%) to (100.00%) world (99.00%) population (100.00%) review (98.00%), there (100.00%) is (77.00%) one (97.00%) point (95.00%) 42 billion (40.00%) people (99.00%) living (95.00%) in (81.00%) China (100.00%), heavy (92.00%) population (100.00%) determine (86.00%) China's (74.00%) numerous (100.00%) varieties (100.00%) of (100.00%) food (99.00%). Chinese (98.00%) food (97.00%) can (97.00%) be (97.00%) roughly (97.00%) divided (100.00%) into (98.00%) eight (94.00%) region (92.00%) cuisines (100.00%) because (85.00%) of (89.00%) the (94.00%) population (93.00%) distribution (98.00%). 

	Speaker 0: 94% (56.00%) of (92.00%) the (93.00%) population (93.00%) is (95.00%) located (95.00%) at (83.00%) east (98.00%) side (90.00%) of (93.00%) China (93.00%). But (87.00%) today (74.00%) we're (88.00%) only (95.00%) going (89.00%) to (89.00%) talk (89.00%) about (92.00%) four (92.00%) Asian (94.00%) cuisines (100.00%) because (96.00%) the (39.00%) of (94.00%) the (98.00%) time (99.00%) limitation (99.00%) Shong (40.00%) provides (85.00%) has (98.00%) a (99.00%) long (99.00%) coast (49.00%), fresh (100.00%) river (99.00%) fish (59.00%). Seafood (98.00%) are (100.00%) always (100.00%) the (96.00%) local (71.00%) favorite (96.00%). The (99.00%) main (100.00%) goal (99.00%) of (99.00%) an (96.00%) authentic (100.00%) Shandong (51.00%) Starship (61.00%) is (100.00%) to (100.00%) preserve (100.00%) the (100.00%) cut (98.00%) color (100.00%) and (100.00%) the (98.00%) taste (100.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) main (99.00%) ingredients (100.00%). So (100.00%) relatively (98.00%) little (100.00%) spice (99.00%) or (31.00%) sugar (98.00%) is (99.00%) used (99.00%) and (80.00%) extremely (100.00%) heat (77.00%). Stir (84.00%) frying (98.00%) cookie (92.00%) method (49.00%) is (98.00%) used (99.00%), which (100.00%) called (95.00%) bow (42.00%). Their (73.00%) chefs (100.00%) love (98.00%) to (100.00%) cook (99.00%) meat (100.00%) and (100.00%) vegetables (100.00%) in (100.00%) a (95.00%) work (96.00%) over (90.00%) a (100.00%) big (100.00%), hot (100.00%) flame (98.00%). They (97.00%) make (100.00%) the (99.00%) oil (99.00%) boil (98.00%) at (98.00%) extremely (100.00%) high (100.00%) temperature (100.00%) and (98.00%) toast (99.00%) in (98.00%) the (97.00%) ingredients (100.00%) for (100.00%) a (78.00%) quick (98.00%) fry (92.00%). This (89.00%) sinks (53.00%), the (93.00%) outer (60.00%) layer (100.00%) and (92.00%) looks (77.00%) into (83.00%) the (100.00%) flavor (100.00%). Also (100.00%) keeps (99.00%) oil (90.00%) from (100.00%) sipping (67.00%) into (100.00%) the (100.00%) food (100.00%). They (52.00%) usually (51.00%) pull (95.00%) out (76.00%) of (59.00%) oil (97.00%) after (100.00%) the (100.00%) main (92.00%) ingredients (100.00%) are (99.00%) cooked (100.00%), and (100.00%) then (100.00%) they (95.00%) will (92.00%) add (55.00%) spices (99.00%) seasoning (99.00%), stir (95.00%) it (44.00%) quickly (100.00%) and (100.00%) very (20.00%) hot (97.00%). 

	Speaker 0: There's (100.00%) only (99.00%) little (99.00%) residual (100.00%) oil (98.00%) on (98.00%) the (99.00%) food (100.00%). This (100.00%) cooking (76.00%) method (98.00%) is (100.00%) called (98.00%) B (46.00%). Next (100.00%) one (99.00%), I (100.00%) will (94.00%) be (100.00%) talking (100.00%) about (100.00%) JSU (46.00%) cuisine (92.00%). JSU (65.00%) cuisine (84.00%) usually (62.00%) have (99.00%) light (99.00%) and (100.00%) sweet (99.00%) flavor (100.00%). Their (50.00%) chefs (99.00%) use (87.00%) very (99.00%) elaborate (100.00%) and (99.00%) precise (100.00%) cooking (63.00%) method (96.00%). And (100.00%) the (33.00%) cookie (45.00%) method (42.00%) are (95.00%) more (97.00%) complex (97.00%) than (98.00%) stir (99.00%) frying (99.00%). The (82.00%) commonly (74.00%) still (70.00%) brace (19.00%) SIMer (55.00%) and (99.00%) warm (81.00%), preserved (96.00%) original (99.00%) flavor (100.00%), and (99.00%) to (95.00%) maintain (100.00%) clarity (94.00%), freshness (100.00%) and (99.00%) mindness (78.00%). The (97.00%) sec (62.00%) third (93.00%) one (95.00%) we're (94.00%) gonna (60.00%) talk (90.00%) about (95.00%) is (92.00%) Suran (57.00%) cuisine (98.00%), their (62.00%) famous (78.00%) of (91.00%) hot (99.00%), spicy (98.00%) taste (88.00%) and (93.00%) numbing (84.00%) flavor (89.00%). The (88.00%) reason (79.00%) that (88.00%) they (22.00%) love (87.00%) spicy (96.00%) food (93.00%) is (97.00%) because (97.00%) Suran (38.00%) is (97.00%) surrounding (99.00%) by (93.00%) mountains (94.00%), geographically (97.00%). They (100.00%) have (100.00%) very (100.00%) humid (94.00%) weather (100.00%), which (100.00%) gives (87.00%) them (98.00%) a (100.00%) hard (100.00%) time (100.00%) to (100.00%) keep (100.00%) warm (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) winter (100.00%). So (100.00%) eating (96.00%) spicy (99.00%) can (65.00%) effectively (99.00%) helping (95.00%) them (97.00%) sweat (93.00%) and (100.00%) get (100.00%) rid (100.00%) of (99.00%) that (95.00%) cold (52.00%). Now (99.00%) SU (86.00%) cuisine (82.00%) is (98.00%) the (99.00%) most (98.00%) wide (53.00%) syrup (7.00%) cuisine (63.00%) in (99.00%) China (100.00%), famous (96.00%) T (44.00%) cuisine (52.00%) dishes (99.00%) that (99.00%) you (100.00%) guys (99.00%) probably (99.00%) know (98.00%) are (99.00%) Mafu (68.00%) and (99.00%) Ko (53.00%) chicken (97.00%). 

	Speaker 0: And (98.00%) the (95.00%) last (100.00%) one (99.00%) we're (99.00%) going (84.00%) to (95.00%) talk (99.00%) about (99.00%) is (99.00%) Guandong (83.00%) cuisine (86.00%). In (98.00%) China (100.00%). We (99.00%) have (100.00%) the (53.00%) joke (97.00%) saying (99.00%) that (99.00%) people (100.00%) from (100.00%) Southern (93.00%) provides (95.00%) a (72.00%) Quando (72.00%) will (56.00%) eat (100.00%) everything (100.00%) with (100.00%) four (96.00%) legs (67.00%) except (93.00%) table (90.00%) and (99.00%) everything (83.00%) that (90.00%) flies (98.00%) except (97.00%) airplanes (99.00%). Although (98.00%) it's (79.00%) an (93.00%) acceleration (70.00%), they (98.00%) do (97.00%) have (99.00%) some (97.00%) dishes (99.00%) might (94.00%) contain (100.00%) snakes (99.00%), dogs (98.00%), and (99.00%) seafood (100.00%) that (98.00%) not (95.00%) familiar (97.00%) to (99.00%) most (94.00%) foreigners (100.00%). So (97.00%) to (95.00%) wrap (97.00%) up (90.00%) this (94.00%) presentation (98.00%) today (99.00%), we (98.00%) talked (98.00%) about (98.00%) Shong (77.00%) cuisine (97.00%), which (100.00%) has (99.00%) a (98.00%) lot (98.00%) of (56.00%) seafood (98.00%) cuisine (69.00%), which (83.00%) has (85.00%) light (98.00%) and (95.00%) sweet (99.00%) flavor (98.00%). Ciran (54.00%) cuisine (90.00%) with (86.00%) hot (97.00%), spicy (99.00%) taste (89.00%) and (83.00%) numbing (63.00%) flavor (92.00%) and (87.00%) cuisine (97.00%) with (70.00%) a (82.00%) lot (91.00%) of (93.00%) wild (86.00%) food (64.00%).
