	Speaker 0: You (100.00%) wake (100.00%) up (100.00%), you (100.00%) accidentally (100.00%) slept (97.00%) past (98.00%) your (99.00%) alarm (100.00%). Temple (54.00%) starts (99.00%) in (100.00%) five (100.00%) minutes (100.00%).

And (98.00%) just (100.00%) like (100.00%) that (92.00%) good (90.00%) morning (100.00%) in (99.00%) a (99.00%) matter (99.00%) of (100.00%) seconds (100.00%) has (79.00%) a (78.00%) conf (39.00%) frantic (100.00%) and (97.00%) a (84.00%) million (89.00%) thoughts (99.00%) are (94.00%) zooming (86.00%) around (98.00%) in (97.00%) your (100.00%) mind (100.00%). What (96.00%) is (86.00%) a (84.00%) typical (100.00%) response (100.00%) to (100.00%) an (99.00%) over (72.00%) little (18.00%) thoughts (100.00%) to (57.00%) things (86.00%) out (74.00%) of (78.00%) our (96.00%) control (99.00%), becoming (99.00%) anxious (100.00%) or (99.00%) simply (100.00%) worrying (100.00%) about (100.00%) our (89.00%) circumstances (100.00%), but (100.00%) has (97.00%) worrying (99.00%) actually (99.00%) ever (96.00%) solved (100.00%) any (99.00%) problems (100.00%) or (100.00%) is (99.00%) it (99.00%) a (100.00%) waste (100.00%) of (100.00%) time (100.00%) is (98.00%) worrying (100.00%) acceptable (100.00%) or (88.00%) the (99.00%) biblical (100.00%) approach (100.00%)__?__ No (100.00%), nothing (100.00%) has (100.00%) ever (98.00%) been (100.00%) solved (100.00%) by (100.00%) worrying (100.00%). And (100.00%) if (71.00%) worrying (100.00%) or (54.00%) a (84.00%) biblical (99.00%) approach (100.00%), there (95.00%) be (94.00%) proper (100.00%) steps (99.00%) to (99.00%) follow (99.00%) for (99.00%) in (96.00%) the (98.00%) Bible (100.00%) for (99.00%) effective (97.00%) worrying (100.00%). But (100.00%) because (99.00%) there (100.00%) are (98.00%) no (97.00%) steps (98.00%) for (99.00%) effective (99.00%) worrying (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Let's (99.00%) look (95.00%) at (85.00%) verse (75.00%) in (94.00%) the (92.00%) Bible (100.00%) that (97.00%) do (95.00%) talk (98.00%) about (100.00%) anxiety (100.00%) and (100.00%) worry (100.00%). The (100.00%) Bible (100.00%) has (100.00%) over (100.00%) 50 (100.00%) verses (99.00%) that (85.00%) directly (99.00%). One (100.00%) tells (100.00%) us (100.00%) not (100.00%) to (100.00%) worry (100.00%). And (100.00%) two (100.00%) tells (100.00%) us (100.00%) how (100.00%) we (100.00%) should (100.00%) respond (100.00%) to (92.00%) things (99.00%) that (99.00%) should (100.00%) trigger (100.00%) us (100.00%) to (100.00%) worry (100.00%). But (100.00%) I'll (96.00%) be (99.00%) only (100.00%) focusing (100.00%) on (99.00%) three (100.00%) and (35.00%) Philippian (96.00%). And (48.00%) four (74.00%) six (89.00%) says (99.00%), do (98.00%) not (100.00%) be (97.00%) anxious (95.00%) about (62.00%) anything (100.00%), but (100.00%) in (96.00%) everything (99.00%) by (99.00%) prayer (100.00%) and (48.00%) supplication (94.00%) with (95.00%) Thanksgiving (100.00%), let (99.00%) your (98.00%) request (99.00%) be (99.00%) made (99.00%) known (99.00%) to (100.00%) God (100.00%). That (100.00%) is (100.00%) the (87.00%) God (100.00%) designed (98.00%) and (100.00%) perfect (100.00%) process (100.00%) of (100.00%) how (100.00%) we (100.00%) should (100.00%) go (100.00%) about (100.00%) our (100.00%) problems (100.00%). No (100.00%) matter (100.00%) what (100.00%) they (100.00%) are (100.00%) worry (95.00%) is (97.00%) evident (99.00%) proof (99.00%) that (99.00%) the (95.00%) system (100.00%) is (98.00%) broken (99.00%) and (100.00%) we (100.00%) live (99.00%) in (99.00%) a (100.00%) world (97.00%) that (99.00%) tries (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) apart (98.00%) from (100.00%) God's (100.00%) design (70.00%) because (87.00%) worry (96.00%) only (99.00%) comes (99.00%) with (98.00%) a (89.00%) perfect (94.00%) worry (98.00%). Only (99.00%) comes (99.00%) with (99.00%) a (94.00%) broken (100.00%) world (100.00%). If (100.00%) it (100.00%) was (100.00%) a (90.00%) perfect (100.00%) world (100.00%), where (100.00%) would (99.00%) worry (94.00%) be (100.00%) in (73.00%) Matthew (97.00%) six (41.00%), it (69.00%) reads (96.00%), therefore (99.00%) I (100.00%) tell (100.00%) you (100.00%) do (99.00%) not (100.00%) be (93.00%) anxious (100.00%) about (100.00%) your (100.00%) life (100.00%) and (99.00%) which (98.00%) of (100.00%) you (100.00%) by (99.00%) being (100.00%) anxious (100.00%) can (100.00%) add (100.00%) a (100.00%) single (100.00%) hour (99.00%) to (99.00%) a (79.00%) span (99.00%) of (99.00%) life (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Both (100.00%) of (100.00%) those (94.00%) verses (99.00%) are (99.00%) command (99.00%) by (94.00%) I (37.00%) God (87.00%). This (98.00%) is (96.00%) shown (100.00%) by (99.00%) the (99.00%) direct (100.00%) phrase (99.00%), do (99.00%) not (99.00%), which (99.00%) I've (95.00%) highlighted (100.00%). There (100.00%) are (99.00%) always (100.00%) reasons (100.00%) why (100.00%) God (100.00%) gives (100.00%) us (99.00%) commands (100.00%). He (100.00%) wants (100.00%) to (100.00%) protect (100.00%) us (100.00%). Disobedience (100.00%) actually (99.00%) hurts (97.00%) us (100.00%). And (99.00%) in (100.00%) this (100.00%) case (100.00%), anxiety (100.00%) can (100.00%) be (100.00%) physically (100.00%) harmful (100.00%). According (100.00%) to (100.00%) the (99.00%) world (98.00%) has (77.00%) health (99.00%) organization (99.00%). Anxiety (100.00%) is (99.00%) a (98.00%) stress (100.00%) on (100.00%) the (100.00%) body (100.00%), anxiety (37.00%) and (65.00%) worry (54.00%) cause (68.00%) stress (92.00%), hormone (97.00%) cortisol (97.00%) to (54.00%) be (93.00%) released (99.00%), which (99.00%) can (99.00%) cause (99.00%) the (98.00%) heart (100.00%) to (100.00%) overwork (99.00%) for (100.00%) no (100.00%) reason (100.00%). Fatigue (100.00%), headaches (100.00%), ingestion (99.00%), and (100.00%) low (100.00%) grade (57.00%) fevers (100.00%) are (100.00%) also (99.00%) related (100.00%) to (100.00%) a (99.00%) consistent (100.00%) release (99.00%) of (100.00%) the (100.00%) hormone (98.00%). Cortisol (99.00%) is (100.00%) supposed (99.00%) to (100.00%) be (99.00%) produced (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) body (100.00%) and (99.00%) stored (99.00%) up (99.00%) for (100.00%) a (95.00%) fight (98.00%) or (94.00%) flight (97.00%) response (100.00%), having (100.00%) problems (100.00%) or (99.00%) having (100.00%) bird (61.00%) is (95.00%) inevitable (99.00%) in (97.00%) an (90.00%) imperfect (99.00%) world (100.00%). But (100.00%) that (100.00%) does (100.00%) not (100.00%) mean (100.00%) that (98.00%) I (48.00%) respons (24.00%) the (74.00%) burden (100.00%) should (99.00%) mean (28.00%) to (100.00%) worry (100.00%). The (79.00%) apostles (100.00%) specifically (100.00%), Paul (90.00%) dealt (52.00%) with (52.00%) burdens (100.00%), imagine (97.00%) being (98.00%) persecuted (99.00%), jailed (98.00%), and (100.00%) knowing (100.00%) that (99.00%) you (100.00%) be (99.00%) murdered (64.00%) soon (100.00%), but (100.00%) still (100.00%) dealing (100.00%) with (100.00%) a (60.00%) responsibility (100.00%) to (100.00%) oversee (93.00%) the (84.00%) developing (100.00%) churches (98.00%) that (100.00%) is (100.00%) called (100.00%) a (97.00%) burden (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: Paul (99.00%) writes (97.00%), and (81.00%) second (95.00%) Corinthians (100.00%). We (100.00%) are (99.00%) afflicted (99.00%) in (99.00%) every (99.00%) way (99.00%), but (100.00%) not (100.00%) crushed (100.00%) perplexed (99.00%), but (100.00%) not (100.00%) despairing (100.00%) persecuted (100.00%), but (100.00%) not (100.00%) forsaken (100.00%) struck (89.00%) down (98.00%), but (100.00%) not (100.00%) destroyed (100.00%). Paul (44.00%) was (98.00%) burdened (98.00%) and (99.00%) burdened (99.00%). Unlike (99.00%) anything (100.00%) that (98.00%) we (100.00%) have (96.00%) ever (84.00%) experienced (100.00%) for (100.00%) sure (100.00%), but (100.00%) burdens (99.00%) we (99.00%) can (99.00%) relate (99.00%) to (87.00%) today (99.00%) can (98.00%) also (97.00%) be (98.00%) family (100.00%), death (95.00%), financial (100.00%) problems (100.00%), a (87.00%) bad (82.00%) grade (57.00%), no (100.00%) matter (100.00%) how (100.00%) hard (100.00%) you (97.00%) studied (99.00%) a (85.00%) basic (43.00%) schedule (98.00%) then (23.00%) of (95.00%) the (84.00%) future (100.00%). Anything (100.00%) that (99.00%) God (100.00%) deems (100.00%) to (100.00%) use (83.00%) as (99.00%) a (97.00%) means (99.00%) to (100.00%) test (98.00%) and (100.00%) grow (100.00%) us (99.00%) in (100.00%) our (99.00%) spiritual (100.00%) walk (100.00%) is (99.00%) a (99.00%) burden (100.00%). Paul (100.00%) did (100.00%) not (100.00%) worry (100.00%) about (100.00%) his (100.00%) current (100.00%) situations (100.00%), no (100.00%) matter (100.00%) extreme (95.00%), they (99.00%) were (99.00%) compared (99.00%) to (100.00%) us (100.00%), but (100.00%) he (100.00%) knew (100.00%) that (99.00%) everything (100.00%) was (100.00%) ultimately (100.00%) controlled (100.00%) by (100.00%) God (100.00%) whom (100.00%) he (100.00%) trusted (100.00%) him (84.00%). This (100.00%) is (100.00%) the (95.00%) same (98.00%) Paul (100.00%) who (99.00%) wrote (100.00%) Philippians (99.00%) four (40.00%), six (90.00%), who (81.00%) told (100.00%) us (100.00%) not (100.00%) to (100.00%) worry (100.00%). And (99.00%) this (92.00%) leads (95.00%) to (48.00%) my (100.00%) third (99.00%) and (96.00%) final (99.00%) point (99.00%). In (72.00%) all (100.00%) circumstances (100.00%), our (92.00%) response (93.00%) to (85.00%) burden (99.00%) should (74.00%) be (100.00%) to (99.00%) go (100.00%) to (99.00%) God (99.00%) and (43.00%) prayer (100.00%). 

	Speaker 0: God (100.00%) is (99.00%) the (99.00%) one (100.00%) who (98.00%) is (65.00%) in (100.00%) control (100.00%) to (95.00%) all (100.00%) knowing (99.00%) what (63.00%) worry (98.00%) is (99.00%), forgetting (98.00%). God's (100.00%) hand (99.00%) everything (100.00%) and (100.00%) taking (98.00%) things (100.00%) into (99.00%) our (100.00%) own (100.00%) hands (100.00%). One (100.00%) academic (100.00%) journal (100.00%) that (99.00%) I (99.00%) came (99.00%) across (100.00%) in (85.00%) my (100.00%) research (100.00%) claims (77.00%) worry (98.00%), becomes (100.00%) reinforced (99.00%) as (99.00%) feared (99.00%) outcomes (99.00%), rarely (100.00%) come (100.00%) to (99.00%) be (99.00%) thus (100.00%) providing (100.00%) the (93.00%) illusion (99.00%) that (100.00%) worry (99.00%) successfully (100.00%) ever (56.00%) a (86.00%) catastrophe (100.00%). Thus (100.00%) worry (99.00%) is (96.00%) a (56.00%) strategies (71.00%) that (100.00%) develops (100.00%) in (94.00%) response (98.00%) to (99.00%) anxiety (100.00%) over (98.00%) uncontrolled (100.00%) outcomes (100.00%) and (100.00%) reinforces (99.00%) itself (100.00%). Over (99.00%) time (99.00%), they (98.00%) identified (100.00%) worry (99.00%) as (100.00%) a (99.00%) habit (100.00%), created (98.00%) an (94.00%) order (100.00%) to (100.00%) dece (99.00%) ourselves (100.00%). That (75.00%) things (100.00%) are (98.00%) actually (100.00%) in (100.00%) our (98.00%) control (100.00%) facing (99.00%) burdens (100.00%) that (100.00%) would (99.00%) normally (100.00%) worry (99.00%) us (98.00%), but (99.00%) seeking (100.00%) God (91.00%). Prayer (99.00%) admits (65.00%) that (98.00%) life (84.00%) in (81.00%) the (74.00%) imperfect (99.00%) world (91.00%) is (99.00%) hard (100.00%), but (100.00%) it's (98.00%) does (98.00%) not (99.00%) deny (100.00%) our (95.00%) faith (100.00%) in (93.00%) God's (100.00%) power (100.00%) politic (60.00%). One (98.00%) of (99.00%) the (96.00%) many (56.00%) that (99.00%) set (99.00%) an (100.00%) example (100.00%) of (100.00%) trust (100.00%) in (71.00%) God (100.00%) in (88.00%) hard (100.00%) times (100.00%). And (96.00%) his (98.00%) example (100.00%) shows (76.00%) that (99.00%) God (100.00%) is (92.00%) glorified (96.00%). When (95.00%) we (100.00%) do (100.00%) not (100.00%) worry (100.00%), God (100.00%) is (99.00%) glorified (97.00%) by (100.00%) our (87.00%) obedience (94.00%) to (100.00%) his (99.00%) commands (100.00%), which (100.00%) is (99.00%) the (93.00%) key (100.00%) issue (100.00%) as (99.00%) to (100.00%) why (98.00%) a (66.00%) worry (93.00%), if (78.00%) not (100.00%) biblical (100.00%). So (98.00%) in (96.00%) summaries (95.00%), don't (100.00%) worry (100.00%) me (71.00%) happy (100.00%).
