	Speaker 1: That's (81.00%) that's (99.00%) a (86.00%) good (100.00%) chunk (100.00%).

	Speaker 0: No (90.00%), we're (96.00%) not (99.00%) testing (99.00%) on (94.00%) people (100.00%) yet (99.00%), but (99.00%) I (91.00%), I (93.00%) think (99.00%) it (99.00%) won't (84.00%) be (100.00%) too (99.00%) long (100.00%). I (100.00%) think (100.00%) we (100.00%) may (98.00%) be (99.00%) able (100.00%) to (100.00%) implant (98.00%) in (55.00%) your (53.00%) link (84.00%) in (95.00%) less (100.00%) than (100.00%) a (100.00%) year (100.00%) in (96.00%) a (99.00%) person (99.00%), I (100.00%) think (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: And (99.00%) when (100.00%) you (100.00%) do (100.00%) this (100.00%), is (100.00%) there (100.00%) any (95.00%) ask (45.00%) that (92.00%) you (98.00%) have (98.00%) to (99.00%) do (98.00%) before (100.00%) you (99.00%) do (100.00%) something (100.00%) like (100.00%) this (100.00%) to (97.00%), to (78.00%) see (100.00%) what (100.00%) percentage (100.00%) of (100.00%) people's (100.00%) bodies (100.00%) are (100.00%) going (100.00%) to (100.00%) reject (100.00%) these (100.00%) things (100.00%)__?__ Is (98.00%) it (89.00%), is (89.00%) it (82.00%), is (95.00%) there (98.00%) a (95.00%) potential (100.00%) for (100.00%) rejection (100.00%)__?__ 

	Speaker 0: It's (86.00%), it's (96.00%) a (100.00%) very (100.00%) low (100.00%) potential (100.00%) for (100.00%) rejection (99.00%).
