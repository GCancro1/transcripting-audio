	Speaker 0: So (93.00%) I'm (98.00%) so (45.00%) it's (70.00%) a (98.00%) little (100.00%) intimidating (100.00%), but (100.00%) what (100.00%) he (100.00%) would (100.00%) do (100.00%) is (99.00%) he (100.00%) would (100.00%) do (100.00%) things (100.00%) indirect (100.00%) and (98.00%) it (100.00%) wasn't (100.00%) about (100.00%) calming (100.00%) the (100.00%) waters (100.00%). It (100.00%) was (100.00%) about (100.00%) stirring (100.00%) up (100.00%) the (100.00%) waters (100.00%) and (99.00%) creating (100.00%) a (100.00%) storm (100.00%) that (100.00%) eventually (100.00%) would (97.00%) lead (98.00%) this (100.00%) broken (100.00%) ship (95.00%) to (100.00%) the (99.00%) shore (100.00%).

And (95.00%) the (99.00%) reason (100.00%) is (99.00%) because (98.00%) the (100.00%) lives (100.00%) of (100.00%) your (100.00%) family (100.00%) are (99.00%) more (100.00%) important (100.00%) than (97.00%) the (94.00%) injury (100.00%) of (100.00%) your (99.00%) hamstring (96.00%). And (98.00%) so (100.00%) when (100.00%) the (99.00%) game (100.00%) is (100.00%) more (100.00%) important (100.00%) than (96.00%) the (100.00%) injury (100.00%) itself (100.00%), you (100.00%) don't (100.00%) feel (100.00%) that (100.00%) damn (97.00%) injury (99.00%).

Even (99.00%) though (95.00%) there (96.00%) was (100.00%) conflict (100.00%), you (96.00%) know (96.00%), maybe (99.00%) if (100.00%) you (97.00%) would've (99.00%) gone (98.00%) round (63.00%) one (99.00%), who (100.00%) knows (100.00%), maybe (99.00%) Dwight (96.00%) would've (100.00%) gone (94.00%) together (100.00%).
