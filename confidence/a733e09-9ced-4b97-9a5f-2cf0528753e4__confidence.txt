	Speaker 1: Thank (99.00%) you (98.00%), Robbie (41.00%). The (100.00%) problem (100.00%) in (100.00%) many (98.00%) industrial (100.00%) settings (100.00%) is (100.00%) downtime (100.00%). Downtime (100.00%) is (100.00%) catastrophically (100.00%) expensive (100.00%) costing (100.00%) $25,000 (96.00%) a (100.00%) minute (100.00%) or (99.00%) one (100.00%) and (66.00%) a (84.00%) half (69.00%) million (99.00%) dollars (74.00%) for (100.00%) every (100.00%) hour (100.00%) in (86.00%) the (100.00%) automotive (100.00%) industry (100.00%) alone (100.00%). With (100.00%) the (99.00%) rise (100.00%) of (100.00%) automation (100.00%), this (100.00%) will (100.00%) compound (100.00%) as (100.00%) more (100.00%) machines (100.00%) will (100.00%) sit (63.00%). Idle (97.00%). Downtime (98.00%) can (98.00%) be (100.00%) looked (100.00%) at (99.00%) from (100.00%) two (100.00%) different (100.00%) angles (100.00%), a (82.00%) machine (100.00%) and (99.00%) a (97.00%) worker (100.00%) machines (100.00%) require (100.00%) maintenance (100.00%) and (99.00%) support (100.00%) from (99.00%) workers (100.00%) and (99.00%) workers (100.00%) require (100.00%) notifications (100.00%) and (99.00%) communication (100.00%) from (100.00%) the (100.00%) machines (100.00%) Machines (100.00%). There's (100.00%) a (100.00%) lot (100.00%) of (100.00%) companies (97.00%) solving (99.00%) the (100.00%) machine (100.00%) side (99.00%) of (100.00%) this (100.00%) by (100.00%) employing (100.00%) sensors (99.00%), generating (98.00%) statistics (100.00%) and (100.00%) ultimately (100.00%) doing (100.00%) analytics (100.00%) to (100.00%) optimize (100.00%) maintenance (100.00%). However (100.00%), as (99.00%) fewer (100.00%) workers (100.00%) are (100.00%) maintaining (100.00%) more (100.00%) machines (100.00%), the (100.00%) worker (99.00%) communication (100.00%) becomes (100.00%) critical (100.00%). This (100.00%) is (100.00%) exactly (100.00%) what's (100.00%) happening (100.00%) at (83.00%) a (77.00%) state (100.00%) of (54.00%) the (61.00%) art (70.00%) Ford (98.00%) factory (100.00%), where (98.00%) they (100.00%) have (99.00%) machines (100.00%) that (86.00%) are (91.00%) connected (99.00%) to (100.00%) dashboard (99.00%) A (99.00%) supervisor (100.00%) monitoring (100.00%) this (97.00%) dashboard (100.00%) issues (100.00%) commands (100.00%) to (99.00%) their (100.00%) technicians (100.00%). If (100.00%) at (100.00%) any (99.00%) point (100.00%) the (100.00%) supervisor (100.00%) or (100.00%) the (99.00%) technician (100.00%) is (100.00%) distracted (100.00%) or (100.00%) miscommunicate (100.00%), that (71.00%) can (99.00%) be (100.00%) many (100.00%) minutes (99.00%) of (57.00%) downtime (97.00%) lost (98.00%). And (100.00%) this (100.00%) happens (100.00%) daily (100.00%) Contributing (100.00%) to (100.00%) roughly (100.00%) 30 (100.00%) minutes (100.00%) of (100.00%) time (99.00%) for (99.00%) this (97.00%) factory (99.00%) per (99.00%) shift (99.00%), Many (100.00%) companies (100.00%), we (100.00%) talk (54.00%) to (100.00%) have (100.00%) similar (100.00%) downtime (100.00%) scenarios (100.00%). They (100.00%) want (100.00%) their (99.00%) workers (100.00%) to (100.00%) be (100.00%) informed (100.00%) faster (100.00%) and (100.00%) more (100.00%) accurately (100.00%). Hello (100.00%) I'm (100.00%) will (44.00%) Shoemaker (85.00%) CEO (87.00%) and (99.00%) founder (100.00%) of (100.00%) uptime (100.00%) where (98.00%) we're (100.00%) building (100.00%) a (100.00%) smarter (100.00%) industrial (100.00%) communication (100.00%) platform (100.00%) to (100.00%) inform (100.00%) workers (100.00%) faster (100.00%) and (97.00%) more (100.00%) effectively (100.00%). 

	Speaker 1: Our (99.00%) solution (100.00%) is (100.00%) to (99.00%) employ (96.00%) smart (100.00%) glasses (93.00%), To (100.00%) deliver (99.00%) notifications (100.00%) directly (100.00%) to (100.00%) a (94.00%) worker's (82.00%) field (96.00%) of (93.00%) view (94.00%) in (100.00%) a (98.00%) timely (100.00%) and (100.00%) accurate (100.00%) manner (100.00%). In (100.00%) addition (100.00%), we'll (99.00%) provide (88.00%), provide (95.00%) a (100.00%) voice (100.00%) driven (61.00%) communication (100.00%) platform (100.00%). So (100.00%) workers (99.00%) can (100.00%) talk (100.00%) with (100.00%) one (100.00%) another (100.00%) in (99.00%) a (99.00%) similar (100.00%) manner (99.00%) to (99.00%) walkie (94.00%) talkies (61.00%). Initially (100.00%) we (100.00%) can (100.00%) use (100.00%) off (99.00%) the (47.00%) shelf (55.00%) smart (99.00%) glasses (89.00%), but (100.00%) eventually (100.00%) we (100.00%) will (95.00%) build (100.00%) our (100.00%) own (100.00%) wearable (100.00%) with (100.00%) the (97.00%) specific (100.00%) needs (100.00%) of (100.00%) industrial (100.00%) communication (100.00%). In (96.00%) mind (100.00%), Within (100.00%) one (100.00%) month (100.00%), our (100.00%) system (100.00%) would (99.00%) pay (100.00%) for (100.00%) itself (100.00%) at (100.00%) the (57.00%) sport (91.00%) factory (100.00%) Over (100.00%) the (100.00%) course (100.00%) of (100.00%) a (87.00%) year (100.00%) we'd (99.00%) return (100.00%). 10 (100.00%) time (85.00%) is (56.00%) the (89.00%) initial (67.00%) investment (99.00%) Netting (98.00%), a (75.00%) savings (100.00%) of (96.00%) 3 million (99.00%) for (99.00%) this (100.00%) one (100.00%) factory (97.00%) by (100.00%) saving (100.00%) a (99.00%) modest (100.00%) half (100.00%) a (97.00%) minute (99.00%) of (100.00%) down (92.00%) Heim (90.00%) per (19.00%) shift (96.00%) Across (100.00%) the (100.00%) us (76.00%). There (99.00%) are (97.00%) 3,500 (99.00%) factories (100.00%) that (99.00%) could (79.00%) leverage (100.00%) the (100.00%) same (100.00%) technology (100.00%), Putting (100.00%) us (100.00%) at (100.00%) a (71.00%) roughly (100.00%) $10 billion (65.00%) market (88.00%) across (95.00%), um (63.00%), of (72.00%) savings (100.00%) across (98.00%) the (100.00%) us (73.00%) manufacturing (100.00%) area (99.00%). And (99.00%) of (100.00%) course (100.00%), manufacturing (100.00%) is (62.00%) not (100.00%) the (100.00%) only (100.00%) Industry (100.00%) that (100.00%) suffers (100.00%) from (100.00%) downtime (100.00%). The (49.00%) construction (100.00%) and (77.00%) oil (100.00%) gas (100.00%) sectors (100.00%) could (99.00%) definitely (100.00%) benefit (100.00%) from (100.00%) having (100.00%) more (100.00%) informed (99.00%) workers (100.00%). Our (100.00%) team (100.00%) is (100.00%) uniquely (100.00%) poised (100.00%) to (100.00%) solve (100.00%) this (100.00%) problem (100.00%) A (100.00%) little (100.00%) bit (99.00%) about (100.00%) myself (100.00%). I (100.00%) grew (100.00%) up (100.00%) in (97.00%) Detroit (100.00%) area (100.00%), my (100.00%) family (100.00%) owned (99.00%) and (73.00%) operated (99.00%) at (57.00%) industrial (100.00%) competing (100.00%) company (100.00%). I (100.00%) went (100.00%) on (97.00%) to (100.00%) get (100.00%) my (100.00%) PhD (99.00%) in (90.00%) physics (56.00%), culminating (97.00%) with (96.00%) a (73.00%) research (98.00%) career (98.00%) at (99.00%) Stanford (100.00%), working (100.00%) on (100.00%) their (99.00%) billion (99.00%) dollar (60.00%) x-ray (100.00%) laser (99.00%) facility (100.00%). This (100.00%) facility (100.00%) suffers (100.00%) a (100.00%) variety (100.00%) of (100.00%) down (100.00%) times (63.00%), 

	Speaker 1: And (100.00%) this (99.00%) inspired (97.00%) me (100.00%) to (100.00%) look (100.00%) for (100.00%) solutions (100.00%). My (100.00%) co-founder (100.00%) Michael (95.00%) is (100.00%) a (99.00%) PhD (93.00%) student (100.00%) in (47.00%) electrical (100.00%) engineering (100.00%) from (99.00%) Stanford (100.00%) with (100.00%) a (99.00%) research (100.00%) focus (99.00%) in (87.00%) acoustics (100.00%) and (91.00%) horrible (73.00%) technologies (100.00%). Our (99.00%) domain (100.00%) advisor (96.00%), Bob (100.00%) has (100.00%) over (100.00%) 40 (100.00%) years (99.00%) experience (100.00%) in (100.00%) the (100.00%) advanced (100.00%) manufacturing (100.00%) area (100.00%). He's (100.00%) set (87.00%) up (90.00%) And (98.00%) supervised (99.00%) numerous (100.00%) factories (100.00%) throughout (100.00%) his (99.00%) career (100.00%) between (100.00%) us (100.00%) with (96.00%) the (99.00%) acoustic (77.00%), the (93.00%) optical (100.00%), the (100.00%) acoustic (99.00%), and (99.00%) the (98.00%) industrial (100.00%) knowledge (100.00%) required (100.00%) to (100.00%) create (100.00%) a (100.00%) new (100.00%) industrial (100.00%) communication (100.00%) system (100.00%) to (100.00%) make (100.00%) a (100.00%) more (100.00%) informed (100.00%) reality (100.00%) for (100.00%) workers (100.00%). If (100.00%) you (100.00%) believe (100.00%) in (99.00%) our (99.00%) more (97.00%) informed (100.00%) reality (100.00%), please (99.00%) come (96.00%), come (96.00%) talk (97.00%) to (98.00%) us (99.00%). Thank (97.00%) you (97.00%).
